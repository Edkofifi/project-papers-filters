Lok,University of Florida; University of Florida; University of Florida; University of Florida; University of Florida; University of Florida,2022 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (VR),20 Apr 2022,2022,,,455,463,"Simulating real-world experiences in a safe environment has made virtual human medical simulations a common use case for research and interpersonal communication training. Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.",2642-5254,978-1-6654-9617-9,10.1109/VR51125.2022.00065,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756762,Human-centered computing;Empirical studies in HCI,Training;Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Medical simulation;Conferences;Computational modeling,biomedical education;computer based training;computer simulation;diseases;epidemics;medical computing;trusted computing;virtual reality,error identification training;learner reliability;learner credibility;life-threatening mistakes;learner error recognition rates;Covid-19 limitations;2x2 mixed design user study;trustworthiness ratings;interpersonal communication training;learner perspectives;virtual human verbal communication mistakes;virtual human medical simulation design;virtual desktop environment experience,,,,33.0,IEEE,20 Apr 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,86,"{'trustworthiness', 'reliability', 'credibility', 'mixed', 'reality', 'virtual'}",6

We define the errors as measurements of hand placement accuracy and consistency within bimanual movement of an interactive virtual object. First, a study is presented which illustrates the amount of variability between the hands and the mean distance of the hands from the surfaces of a common virtual object. The results allow a discussion of the most significant factors which should be considered in the frame of developing realistic mixed reality interaction systems. The degree of error was found to be independent of interaction speed, whilst the size of virtual object and the position of the hands are significant. Second, a further study illustrates how perceptible these errors are to a third person viewer of the interaction (e.g. an audience member). We found that interaction errors arising from the overestimation of an object surface affected the visual credibility for the viewer considerably more than an underestimation of the object.

To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed.

If the viewpoint of the VR user can be predicted in advance, only the required viewpoint is needed to be rendered and delivered, which can reduce the VR interaction latency. Therefore, in this paper, we use offline and online learning algorithms to predict viewpoint of the VR user using real VR dataset. For the offline learning algorithm, the trained learning model is directly used to predict the viewpoint of VR users in continuous time slots. While for the online learning algorithm, based on the VR user's actual viewpoint delivered through uplink transmission, we compare it with the predicted viewpoint and update the parameters and input viewpoints of the online learning algorithm to further improve the prediction accuracy. To guarantee the reliability of the uplink transmission, we integrate the Proactive retransmission scheme into our proposed online learning algorithm.

This study hypothesises that the utilisation of VR technology to demonstrate SHP technique will produce superior skill acquisition and longer skill retention than the standard practice of video demonstration. 40 healthcare students unfamiliar with SHP were recruited from a tertiary university and randomised into two groups. The control group (n=21) viewed a video demonstration of SHP while the VR group (n=19) viewed a VR demonstration of the same technique. Participants were assessed immediately after demonstration (acquisition score), and again one week later (retention score), using a 20-point assessment scale. Scores were compared between the groups. Groups were equal in age, prior education, handedness and gender distribution. Neither skill acquisition (Control mean: 12.29, VR mean: 12.84; p = 0.57) nor retention (Control mean: 12.29, VR mean: 12.74; p = 0.52) differed significantly between groups however a non-significant trend toward better performance in the VR group was observed.

This paper proposes a multiuser MAC scheduling scheme for VR service in 5G MIMO-OFDM system, which can maximize the number of simultaneous VR clients while guaranteeing their 3UH quality-of-experience (QoE). Specifically, this scheme is composed of three novel functions, including video frame differentiation and delay-based weight calculation, spatial-frequency user selection based on maximum aggregate delay-capacity utility (ADCU), and link adaptation with dynamic block-error-rate (BLER) target. In addition, a low-complexity downlink MIMO user selection algorithm is developed, which can reduce the calculation amount with one order. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that the proposed scheme increases 31.6% for the maximum number of simultaneously served VR users than the traditional scheme with maximum-sum-capacity based scheduling and fixed BLER target based link adaptation.",2474-9133,978-1-5386-4328-0,10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403486,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403486,,Streaming media;Wireless communication;5G mobile communication;Servers;Base stations;Payloads;Reliability,5G mobile communication;access protocols;Internet;MIMO communication;multi-access systems;OFDM modulation;quality of experience;radio links;telecommunication scheduling;video streaming;virtual reality,untethered connection;VR server;ultra-high data rate;ultra-high transfer reliability;video streaming;ultra-high responsive speed;ultra-high requirements;multiuser MAC scheduling scheme;VR service;simultaneous VR clients;3UH quality-of-experience;video frame differentiation;spatial-frequency user selection;maximum aggregate delay-capacity utility;dynamic block-error-rate target;low-complexity downlink MIMO user selection algorithm;simultaneously served VR users;multiuser wireless virtual reality;5G MIMO-OFDM systems;motion-to-photon latency;generalized tactile Internet;delay-based weight calculation;ADCU;link adaptation;BLER,,9.0,,15.0,IEEE,5 Jul 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,43,"{'reliability', 'virtual', 'reality'}",3

The reliability and validity of these sway parameters to measure postural stability were evaluated. Twenty healthy adults had their postural sway measured with this system and a force platform system under four stance conditions, with wideor narrow-stance and eyes open or closed. The path data from both systems were computed to obtain the following parameters: the mean distance and the mean velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and the 95% confidence ellipse area. The reliability of the Vive-based sway measures was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The convergent validity was tested against the center of pressure (COP) parameters from the force platform system. Finally, the discriminative validity was tested for the above four conditions. The results indicated that the Vive-based sway parameters had moderate to high reliability (ICCs: 0.56 ~ 0.90) across four conditions and correlated moderately to very highly with the COP parameters (r = 0.420 ~ 0.959). Bland-Altman plotting showed generally good agreement, with negative offset for the Vive-based sway parameters.

Thus, quantifying both near- and far-space neglect is crucial. This study aims to propose an index to quantify the near/far spatial neglect ratio to describe the USN symptoms' characteristics in each patient using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology. An object-detecting task was performed for five USN patients in a three-dimensional VR space. The examiner recorded the positional data of the objects that were recognized by the USN patient using coordinate data. The near/far ratio (NFRatio) was calculated using the proposed equation to quantify the difference in neglect severity in near and far spaces of each patient. Among the patients, four tended to have greater far-space neglect, and one tended to have greater near-space neglect.

This high data rate over short transmission distances may be achieved via the abundant bandwidth in the terahertz (THz) band. However, THz waves experience severe signal attenuation, which may be compensated by the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology with programmable reflecting elements. Meanwhile, the low VR interaction latency can be achieved with the mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture due to its computation capabilities. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we propose an MEC-enabled and RIS-assisted THz VR network in an indoor scenario, by taking into account the uplink viewpoint prediction and position transmission, the MEC rendering, and the downlink transmission. We propose two methods, which are referred to as centralized online gated recurrent unit (GRU) and distributed federated averaging (FedAvg), to predict the viewpoints of the VR users.

In this paper, a terahertz (THz) cellular network is considered to provide high-rate VR services, thus enabling a successful visual perception. For this network, guaranteeing URLLC with high rates requires overcoming the uncertainty stemming from the THz channel. To this end, the achievable reliability and latency of VR services over THz links are characterized. In particular, a novel expression for the probability distribution function of the transmission delay is derived as a function of the system parameters. Subsequently, the end-to-end (E2E) delay distribution that takes into account both processing and transmission delay is found and a tractable expression of the reliability of the system is derived as a function of the THz network parameters such as the molecular absorption loss and noise, the transmitted power, and the distance between the VR user and its respective small base station (SBS). Numerical results show the effects of various system parameters such as the bandwidth and the region of non-negligible interference on the reliability of the system. In particular, the results show that THz can deliver rates up to 16.4 Gbps and a reliability of 99.999% (with a delay threshold of 30 ms) provided that the impact of the molecular absorption on the THz links, which substantially limits the communication range of the SBS, is alleviated by densifying the network accordingly.",2157-4960,978-1-7281-1542-9,10.1109/NTMS.2019.8763780,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8763780,virtual reality (VR);terahertz;reliability;ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC),Reliability;Delays;Wireless communication;Interference;Absorption;Quality of service;Propagation losses,cellular radio;molecular communication (telecommunication);probability;radio links;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication network reliability;virtual reality;visual perception;wireless channels,URLLC;dual VR perception;cellular network;high-rate VR services;THz channel;probability distribution function;transmission delay;molecular absorption loss;ultrareliable low latency communications;visual perception;wireless virtual reality reliability services;THz network parameter links;terahertz cellular network;THz cellular network;end-to-end delay distribution;E2E delay distribution;SBS;small base station;interference;time 30.0 ms,,24.0,,15.0,IEEE,15 Jul 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,43,"{'reliability', 'virtual', 'reality'}",3

Two human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for seizure localization were asked to discriminate between visually identical virtual objects based on their distinct SI-DCS neurohaptic profiles. In a binary discrimination task, neurohaptic feedback was either present or absent while grasping a virtual object. In the ternary discrimination task, neurohaptic feedback was either present in one of two distinct neurohaptic sequences or absent.

This high data rate over short transmission distances may be achieved via the abundant spectrum in the terahertz (THz) band. However, THz waves suffer from severe signal attenuation, which may be compensated by the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology with adjustable phase-shift of each reflecting element. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we propose an RIS-assisted THz VR network in an indoor scenario, taking into account the viewpoint prediction and downlink transmission. We first propose a genie-aided online gated recurrent unit (GRU) and integration of online long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to predict the viewpoint, location, and the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) statuses of the VR users over time, with the aim to optimize the long-term QoE of the VR users. We then develop a constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm to select the optimal phase shifts of the RIS for the downlink transmission under latency constraints.

Therefore, in this paper, we use online learning algorithms to predict viewpoint of the VR user using real VR dataset. For the online learning algorithm, based on the VR user’s actual viewpoint delivered through uplink transmission, we compare it with the predicted viewpoint and update the parameters of the online learning algorithm to further improve the prediction accuracy.

In particular, this problem is considered within a cellular network that employs terahertz (THz) operated RISs acting as base stations. To provide a seamless VR experience, high data rates and reliable low latency need to be continuously guaranteed. To address these challenges, a novel risk-based framework based on the entropic value-at-risk is proposed for rate optimization and reliability performance. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimization technique is used to reformulate the problem as a linear weighted function, while ensuring that higher order statistics of the queue length are maintained under a threshold. To address this problem, given the stochastic nature of the channel, a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed. Since the state space is extremely large, the policy is learned through a deep-RL algorithm. In particular, a recurrent neural network (RNN) RL framework is proposed to capture the dynamic channel behavior and improve the speed of conventional RL policy-search algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the maximal queue length resulting from the proposed approach is only within 1% of the optimal solution.

Among the most common sensorimotor symptoms of mTBI is balance impairment. A commonly used assessments of balance following mTBI is the sensory organization test (SOT). This test has shown that postural deficits following head injury may be due to visual-vestibular processing issues, but it is less sensitive to unremitting symptoms that do not spontaneously resolve within a week. Our current project involves demonstrating validity and reliability of a novel low-cost, portable virtual reality-based balance screening device that employs established principles of sensorimotor reweighting and visual-vestibular integration. The goal is to determine if it can replace existing tools that are either prohibitively expensive or lack reliability or sensitivity. Methods: Healthy adults with no known musculoskeletal or neurological injury (n=27; 17 males, 10 females; 22.1±3.9 years) were tested to establish healthy norms. Individuals with mTBI (n=8; 4 males, 4 females; 20.0±1.7 years) were compared to the healthy norms. The new VR-based balance assessment system consists of a Wii balance board (WBB), a large screen television, and a custom-designed software user interface used to collect and process data. Subjects performed six upright postural tasks (three visual conditions either standing directly on the WBB or on foam placed on the WBB). Subjects viewed a virtual reality scene displayed on a 60"" television. The three visual conditions were Static Scene, Dark Scene, and Dynamic Scene (Roll at 60 deg/s). The WBB recorded COP at 100Hz for 30 sec. Dependent variables included COP velocity, root mean square, and sway area. Subjects also performed the sensory organization test (SOT), which can be used as criterion-measures for intraclass correlations with the new device. Results: Preliminary data on healthy subjects validates effectiveness of the device to reduce postural stability as sensory input reliability and availability decreases. Additionally, ur results reveal that individuals with mTBI have significantly worse balance scores on the new VR-device (p<;0.001). This highlights its sensitivity to balance disturbance even if when testing a small sample. Comparison of the new device to SOT shows good criterion validity with ROC curves revealing sensitivity/specificity equal or higher than the SOT. COP sway area, velocity, and standard deviation of medial-lateral and anterior-posterior sway were all sensitive dependent variables. In conclusion, this study helps demonstrate that our new VR-based assessment tool is a valid measure for detecting balance related changes in neurologically impaired individuals and can potentially replace much more expensive equipment. Using postural control as an outcome measure of brain injury may help improve identification of individuals with sub-acute symptoms which may be used to guide rehabilitation and clinical decision-making.",2331-9569,978-1-4799-8984-3,10.1109/ICVR.2015.7358591,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358591,vestibular;visual;virtual environment;concussion,Reliability;Brain injuries;Organizations;Sensitivity;TV;Visualization,biomedical equipment;bone;decision making;injuries;mean square error methods;medical computing;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;reliability;virtual reality,portable virtual reality balance device;mild traumatic brain injury symptoms;head impact;blast exposure;diffuse injury;cognition;emotional processes;sensorimotor symptoms;sensory organization testing;mTBI;head injury;visual-vestibular processing;unremitting symptoms;portable virtual reality-based balance screening device;visual-vestibular integration;healthy adults;musculoskeletal injury;neurological injury;VR-based balance assessment system;Wii balance board;large screen television;custom-designed software;user interface;upright postural tasks;virtual reality;visual conditions;COP velocity;root mean square;postural stability;sensory input reliability;ROC curves;COP sway area;standard deviation;medial-lateral sway;anterior-posterior sway;sensitive dependent variables;VR-based assessment tool;neurologically impaired individuals;postural control;subacute symptoms;rehabilitation;clinical decision-making;frequency 100 Hz;time 30 s,,2.0,,31.0,IEEE,17 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,43,"{'reliability', 'virtual', 'reality'}",3
