Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.",2642-5254,978-1-6654-9617-9,10.1109/VR51125.2022.00065,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756762,Human-centered computing;Empirical studies in HCI,Training;Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Medical simulation;Conferences;Computational modeling,biomedical education;computer based training;computer simulation;diseases;epidemics;medical computing;trusted computing;virtual reality,error identification training;learner reliability;learner credibility;life-threatening mistakes;learner error recognition rates;Covid-19 limitations;2x2 mixed design user study;trustworthiness ratings;interpersonal communication training;learner perspectives;virtual human verbal communication mistakes;virtual human medical simulation design;virtual desktop environment experience,,,,33.0,IEEE,20 Apr 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,57,"{'reliability', 'trustworthiness', 'virtual', 'credibility'}",4

In this paper, a terahertz (THz) cellular network is considered to provide high-rate VR services, thus enabling a successful visual perception. For this network, guaranteeing URLLC with high rates requires overcoming the uncertainty stemming from the THz channel. To this end, the achievable reliability and latency of VR services over THz links are characterized. In particular, a novel expression for the probability distribution function of the transmission delay is derived as a function of the system parameters. Subsequently, the end-to-end (E2E) delay distribution that takes into account both processing and transmission delay is found and a tractable expression of the reliability of the system is derived as a function of the THz network parameters such as the molecular absorption loss and noise, the transmitted power, and the distance between the VR user and its respective small base station (SBS). Numerical results show the effects of various system parameters such as the bandwidth and the region of non-negligible interference on the reliability of the system. In particular, the results show that THz can deliver rates up to 16.4 Gbps and a reliability of 99.999% (with a delay threshold of 30 ms) provided that the impact of the molecular absorption on the THz links, which substantially limits the communication range of the SBS, is alleviated by densifying the network accordingly.",2157-4960,978-1-7281-1542-9,10.1109/NTMS.2019.8763780,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8763780,virtual reality (VR);terahertz;reliability;ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC),Reliability;Delays;Wireless communication;Interference;Absorption;Quality of service;Propagation losses,cellular radio;molecular communication (telecommunication);probability;radio links;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication network reliability;virtual reality;visual perception;wireless channels,URLLC;dual VR perception;cellular network;high-rate VR services;THz channel;probability distribution function;transmission delay;molecular absorption loss;ultrareliable low latency communications;visual perception;wireless virtual reality reliability services;THz network parameter links;terahertz cellular network;THz cellular network;end-to-end delay distribution;E2E delay distribution;SBS;small base station;interference;time 30.0 ms,,24.0,,15.0,IEEE,15 Jul 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,43,"{'reliability', 'virtual', 'reality'}",3

If the trust of a person on machines is high, then they can say that humans are more dependent on machines. Physiological sensor data such as electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) are being used to evaluate the trust.

To ensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile users and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are exploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the wireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a sequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users’ feeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption constraints on access points (APs) and users’ head-mounted displays (HMDs). The problem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users’ accurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer characteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state network (ESN) learning method to predict users’ tracking information by training fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs. With the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer decision variables and solve a continuous power control problem to criticize the integer decision variables.

The platform involves the interaction of multiple computers and programs and allows for selection of different avatar arms and for modification of a selected arm's visual properties. The system was tested with two non-human primates (NHP) that were trained to reach to multiple targets on a tabletop. Reliability of arm visual feedback was altered by applying different levels of blurring to the arm. In addition, tactile feedback was altered by adding or removing physical targets from the environment. We observed differences in movement endpoint distributions that varied between animals and visual feedback conditions, as well as across targets. The results indicate that the system can be used to study multisensory integration in a well-controlled manner.",2694-0604,978-1-7281-1990-8,10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175439,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175439,,Avatars;Visualization;Joints;Multisensory integration;Brain modeling;Animals,avatars;biomechanics;haptic interfaces;medical control systems;neurophysiology;prosthetics,multisensory integration;closed-loop neural prosthetic control;sensory modalities;nervous system;closed-loop neural prosthetic systems;virtual reality;arm visual feedback;avatar arms;upper limb;nonhuman primates,"Animals;Feedback;Feedback, Sensory;Movement;Reproducibility of Results;Virtual Reality",1.0,,11.0,CCBY,27 Aug 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

We define the errors as measurements of hand placement accuracy and consistency within bimanual movement of an interactive virtual object. First, a study is presented which illustrates the amount of variability between the hands and the mean distance of the hands from the surfaces of a common virtual object. The results allow a discussion of the most significant factors which should be considered in the frame of developing realistic mixed reality interaction systems. The degree of error was found to be independent of interaction speed, whilst the size of virtual object and the position of the hands are significant. Second, a further study illustrates how perceptible these errors are to a third person viewer of the interaction (e.g. an audience member). We found that interaction errors arising from the overestimation of an object surface affected the visual credibility for the viewer considerably more than an underestimation of the object. This work is presented within the application of a real-time Interactive Virtual Television Studio, which offers convincing realtime interaction for live TV production.

In this study, we leveraged a novel virtual reality (VR) experimental platform to evaluate SI-DCS neurohaptic feedback during naturalistic object interaction. Two human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for seizure localization were asked to discriminate between visually identical virtual objects based on their distinct SI-DCS neurohaptic profiles. In a binary discrimination task, neurohaptic feedback was either present or absent while grasping a virtual object. In the ternary discrimination task, neurohaptic feedback was either present in one of two distinct neurohaptic sequences or absent. Both subjects performed significantly above chance in binary and ternary discrimination, demonstrating the efficacy of S1-DCS as neurohaptic feedback. Successful ternary discrimination also demonstrated that different sequences of amplitude-modulated SI-DCS at a single pair of electrodes can evoke discriminable neurohaptic percepts.

Appiah-Kubi,"Department of Physical Therapy Department of Bioengineering Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Kinesiology Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Physical Therapy Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA",2015 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR),17 Dec 2015,2015,,,72,79,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) following a head impact or blast exposure can cause diffuse injury to the brain, which can affect sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional processes. Among the most common sensorimotor symptoms of mTBI is balance impairment. A commonly used assessments of balance following mTBI is the sensory organization test (SOT). This test has shown that postural deficits following head injury may be due to visual-vestibular processing issues, but it is less sensitive to unremitting symptoms that do not spontaneously resolve within a week. Our current project involves demonstrating validity and reliability of a novel low-cost, portable virtual reality-based balance screening device that employs established principles of sensorimotor reweighting and visual-vestibular integration. The goal is to determine if it can replace existing tools that are either prohibitively expensive or lack reliability or sensitivity. Methods: Healthy adults with no known musculoskeletal or neurological injury (n=27; 17 males, 10 females; 22.1±3.9 years) were tested to establish healthy norms. Individuals with mTBI (n=8; 4 males, 4 females; 20.0±1.7 years) were compared to the healthy norms. The new VR-based balance assessment system consists of a Wii balance board (WBB), a large screen television, and a custom-designed software user interface used to collect and process data. Subjects performed six upright postural tasks (three visual conditions either standing directly on the WBB or on foam placed on the WBB). Subjects viewed a virtual reality scene displayed on a 60"" television. The three visual conditions were Static Scene, Dark Scene, and Dynamic Scene (Roll at 60 deg/s). The WBB recorded COP at 100Hz for 30 sec. Dependent variables included COP velocity, root mean square, and sway area. Subjects also performed the sensory organization test (SOT), which can be used as criterion-measures for intraclass correlations with the new device. Results: Preliminary data on healthy subjects validates effectiveness of the device to reduce postural stability as sensory input reliability and availability decreases. Additionally, ur results reveal that individuals with mTBI have significantly worse balance scores on the new VR-device (p<;0.001). This highlights its sensitivity to balance disturbance even if when testing a small sample. Comparison of the new device to SOT shows good criterion validity with ROC curves revealing sensitivity/specificity equal or higher than the SOT. COP sway area, velocity, and standard deviation of medial-lateral and anterior-posterior sway were all sensitive dependent variables. In conclusion, this study helps demonstrate that our new VR-based assessment tool is a valid measure for detecting balance related changes in neurologically impaired individuals and can potentially replace much more expensive equipment. Using postural control as an outcome measure of brain injury may help improve identification of individuals with sub-acute symptoms which may be used to guide rehabilitation and clinical decision-making.",2331-9569,978-1-4799-8984-3,10.1109/ICVR.2015.7358591,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358591,vestibular;visual;virtual environment;concussion,Reliability;Brain injuries;Organizations;Sensitivity;TV;Visualization,biomedical equipment;bone;decision making;injuries;mean square error methods;medical computing;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;reliability;virtual reality,portable virtual reality balance device;mild traumatic brain injury symptoms;head impact;blast exposure;diffuse injury;cognition;emotional processes;sensorimotor symptoms;sensory organization testing;mTBI;head injury;visual-vestibular processing;unremitting symptoms;portable virtual reality-based balance screening device;visual-vestibular integration;healthy adults;musculoskeletal injury;neurological injury;VR-based balance assessment system;Wii balance board;large screen television;custom-designed software;user interface;upright postural tasks;virtual reality;visual conditions;COP velocity;root mean square;postural stability;sensory input reliability;ROC curves;COP sway area;standard deviation;medial-lateral sway;anterior-posterior sway;sensitive dependent variables;VR-based assessment tool;neurologically impaired individuals;postural control;subacute symptoms;rehabilitation;clinical decision-making;frequency 100 Hz;time 30 s,,2.0,,31.0,IEEE,17 Dec 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

In particular, this problem is considered within a cellular network that employs terahertz (THz) operated RISs acting as base stations. To provide a seamless VR experience, high data rates and reliable low latency need to be continuously guaranteed. To address these challenges, a novel risk-based framework based on the entropic value-at-risk is proposed for rate optimization and reliability performance. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimization technique is used to reformulate the problem as a linear weighted function, while ensuring that higher order statistics of the queue length are maintained under a threshold. To address this problem, given the stochastic nature of the channel, a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed. Since the state space is extremely large, the policy is learned through a deep-RL algorithm. In particular, a recurrent neural network (RNN) RL framework is proposed to capture the dynamic channel behavior and improve the speed of conventional RL policy-search algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the maximal queue length resulting from the proposed approach is only within 1% of the optimal solution. The results show a high accuracy and fast convergence for the RNN with a validation accuracy of 91.92%.",1938-1883,978-1-7281-5089-5,10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149411,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149411,Virtual Reality;Terahertz;Reliability,Reliability;Wireless communication;Optimization;Delays;Heuristic algorithms;Virtual reality;Recurrent neural networks,computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;queueing theory;recurrent neural nets;stochastic processes;virtual reality,cellular network;RISs;base stations;seamless VR experience;high data rates;risk-based framework;entropic value-at-risk;rate optimization;Lyapunov optimization technique;linear weighted function;higher order statistics;policy-based reinforcement learning algorithm;deep-RL algorithm;recurrent neural network RL framework;dynamic channel behavior;maximal queue length;risk-based optimization;terahertz reconfigurable intelligent surfaces;virtual reality users;wireless VR network;RL policy-search algorithms,,36.0,,21.0,IEEE,27 Jul 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

To make such interaction smooth, proper interaction approaches are needed. Customarily these are tested in simplified scenarios and tame laboratory environment, since reproducing complex real use cases is often difficult. Achieved results are then not representative of actual interaction in reality and do not scale to complex scenarios. To overcome this issue, in this paper we consider the use of virtual reality as an alternative tool to assess HRI in those scenarios that are difficult to reproduce in reality. To this end, we compare the interaction experience for the same task, which is carried out in both virtual reality and real environment. To assess user's interaction in the two scenarios, we consider quantitative task related metrics, mental workload sustained, and subjective reporting.

They can enhance people’s self-efficacy and knowledge about, for example, social interactions as previous studies have shown. Ownership and plausibility of these VCs are regarded as important for their effect, and enhancing both might, therefore, be beneficial. A potential strategy for achieving this is the synchronization of the VCs with people’s eye fixation using eye-tracking technology embedded in a head-mounted display. Hence, this paper tests this idea in the context of a pre-therapy for spider and snake phobia to examine the ability to guide people’s eye fixation. An experiment with 24 participants was conducted using a within-subjects design. Each participant was exposed to two conditions: one where the VCs were adapted to eye gaze of the participant and the other where they were not adapted, i.e. the control condition. The findings of a Bayesian analysis suggest that credibly more ownership was reported and more eye-gaze shift behaviour was observed in the eye-gaze-adapted condition than in the control condition. Compared to the alternative of no or negative mediation, the findings also give some more credibility to the hypothesis that ownership, at least partly, positively mediates the effect eye-gaze-adapted VCs have on eye-gaze shift behaviour. Only weak support was found for plausibility as a mediator. These findings help improve insight into how VCs affect people.",1873-7951,,10.1093/iwcomp/iwab008,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520909,eye tracking;eye-gaze adaptive;virtual cognitions;virtual reality exposure;spider phobia;snake phobia,,,,,,,,,23 Aug 2021,,,OUP,OUP Journals,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

Even though it was proven that VR functions do provide some relief in travel security concern, a stronger VR website can be built when narrative video clips that show video clips with narration about important aspects of the hotel. Thus we created a video clip that showed and narrated about the escape route from the hotel room, another video clip that showed and narrated about surrounding neighborhood. We then conducted experiments with this enhanced VR website of a hotel by having human subjects play with the website and fill out a questionnaire. The result confirms our hypothesis that there is a statistically significant relationship between the degree of travel security concern and psychological relief caused by the use of embedded VR functions with narrative video clips of a hotel website.",2162-9048,978-1-4673-1401-5,10.1109/ICISA.2012.6220974,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220974,,Security;Solid modeling;Testing;Analytical models;Reliability;Data models;Probability,hotel industry;security of data;travel industry;video signal processing;virtual reality;Web sites,virtual reality;travel security;VR website;narrative video clip;questionnaire;psychological relief;embedded VR functions;hotel Web site,,2.0,,25.0,IEEE,21 Jun 2012,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users' reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content transmission format for each cellular-connected UAV.

Therefore, in this paper, we use offline and online learning algorithms to predict viewpoint of the VR user using real VR dataset. For the offline learning algorithm, the trained learning model is directly used to predict the viewpoint of VR users in continuous time slots. While for the online learning algorithm, based on the VR user's actual viewpoint delivered through uplink transmission, we compare it with the predicted viewpoint and update the parameters and input viewpoints of the online learning algorithm to further improve the prediction accuracy.

The control group (n=21) viewed a video demonstration of SHP while the VR group (n=19) viewed a VR demonstration of the same technique. Participants were assessed immediately after demonstration (acquisition score), and again one week later (retention score), using a 20-point assessment scale. Scores were compared between the groups. Groups were equal in age, prior education, handedness and gender distribution.

This is achieved by using ground truth data in form of simulation scenarios from real world measurement data.

In addition, a low-complexity downlink MIMO user selection algorithm is developed, which can reduce the calculation amount with one order.

Based on detailed performance evaluations conducted using 5G system setting, it is shown that the optimized mechanism can provide significant gains in terms of cell-edge user throughput and resultant spectral requirements for broadcast. The performance gains are obtained due to the ability of the system to optimize the operating point, instead of targeting the worst user which has been the traditional approach for broadcast.

Results indicate that touch in VR is possible without a visual representation of the hand, but accuracy is influenced by how the device is held and the distance traveled to the target.

In this work, we propose a methodology to validate the user experience in AVs based on continuous, objective information gathered from physiological signals, while the user is immersed in a Virtual Reality-based driving simulation. We applied this methodology to the design of a head-up display interface delivering visual cues about the vehicle's sensory and planning systems. Through this approach, we obtained qualitative and quantitative evidence that a complete picture of the vehicle's surrounding, despite the higher cognitive load, is conducive to a less stressful experience.

With the need of highly reliable processes, the semiconductor industry is interested in developing methodologies covering the gap of missing metrology information. Virtual Metrology (VM) turns out to be a promising method; it aims to predict wafer and/or site fine metrology results in real time and free of costs. Using virtual measurements as the input of a sampling decision system (SDS), an optimal strategy for measuring productive wafers can be suggested. Since sampling decisions strongly depend on the accuracy of the VM system, it is a key requirement to monitor the reliability of the obtained predictions. In this paper, we present approaches for dynamically assessing VM reliability using real metrology data. A Bayesian dynamical linear model (BDLM) handles increasing VM model uncertainty over time. Model parameters are updated whenever new real measurements become available. VM prediction quality is monitored applying a probability integral transform (PIT) and scoring rules for predictive probability distributions. Inferring equipment health factors (EHF), unreliable predictions can be detected before being delivered to the SDS. Based on the likelihood of the predicted measurements, VM trust factors are introduced. A Bayesian model for the prediction precision matrix allows updating the virtual measurements' uncertainty whenever real measurements are available.

We conducted a study in which 8 people were playing a set of VR games with two EMG sensors placed on their arms. We analysed the EMG signals and extracted a number of features to infer the affective states of the players. Our experimental results show that the EMG measures from left and right arms provide sufficient information to detect emotions experienced by a player of a VR game.

Thus, quantifying both near- and far-space neglect is crucial. This study aims to propose an index to quantify the near/far spatial neglect ratio to describe the USN symptoms' characteristics in each patient using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology. An object-detecting task was performed for five USN patients in a three-dimensional VR space. The examiner recorded the positional data of the objects that were recognized by the USN patient using coordinate data. The near/far ratio (NFRatio) was calculated using the proposed equation to quantify the difference in neglect severity in near and far spaces of each patient. Among the patients, four tended to have greater far-space neglect, and one tended to have greater near-space neglect. Moreover, the near/far spatial neglect ratio was shown to vary according to height. This is the first study to propose immersive VR to quantify the near and far spatial neglect. However, further study is needed to assess its reliability and validity and describe its clinical usability.

The reliability and validity of these sway parameters to measure postural stability were evaluated. Twenty healthy adults had their postural sway measured with this system and a force platform system under four stance conditions, with wideor narrow-stance and eyes open or closed. The path data from both systems were computed to obtain the following parameters: the mean distance and the mean velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and the 95% confidence ellipse area. The reliability of the Vive-based sway measures was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The convergent validity was tested against the center of pressure (COP) parameters from the force platform system. Finally, the discriminative validity was tested for the above four conditions. The results indicated that the Vive-based sway parameters had moderate to high reliability (ICCs: 0.56 ~ 0.90) across four conditions and correlated moderately to very highly with the COP parameters (r = 0.420 ~ 0.959).

Stein,"Otto Creutzfeldt Center for Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience, Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster",2021 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops (VRW),6 May 2021,2021,,,727,728,"Locomotion and vison are closely linked. When users explore virtual environments by walking they rely on stable visible landmarks to plan and execute their next movement. In my research I am developing novel methods to predict locomotion paths of human subjects for the immediate future, i.e. the next few seconds. I aim to connect different types of behavioral data (eye, hand, feet and head tracking) and test their reliability and validity for predicting walking behavior in virtual reality. Such a prediction will be very valuable for natural interaction, for example in redirected walking schemes.My approach begins with an evaluation of the quality of data gathered with current tracking methods. Informative experimental conditions need to be developed to find meaningful patterns in natural walking. Next, raw tracked data of different modalities need to be connected with each other and aggregated in a useful way. Thereafter, possible valid predictors need to be developed and compared to already functioning predicting algorithms (e.g. [2],[6],[12]). As a final goal, all valid predictors shall be used to create a prediction algorithm returning the most likely future path when exploring virtual environments.",,978-1-6654-4057-8,10.1109/VRW52623.2021.00246,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419235,Virtual Reality;Locomotion;Path Prediction;Eye Tracking,Legged locomotion;Three-dimensional displays;Tracking;Conferences;Virtual environments;Gaze tracking;User interfaces,gait analysis;gaze tracking;human computer interaction;tracking;virtual reality;visual perception,virtual reality;eye tracking;vison;virtual environments;stable visible landmarks;locomotion paths;human subjects;immediate future;behavioral data;head tracking;reliability;walking behavior;natural interaction;redirected walking schemes;tracking methods;informative experimental conditions;natural walking;raw tracked data;valid predictors;predicting algorithms;prediction algorithm;future path,,3.0,,19.0,IEEE,6 May 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

Min,Shandong College of Electronic Technology China,2020 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Intelligent Systems (ICVRIS),21 Sep 2021,2020,,,38,41,"At present, the timeliness of updating path information in e-commerce logistics distribution path display system is poor, which leads to a large deviation between the distribution path displayed by the system and the actual path, low system reliability, and affects the user experience. In order to solve the above problems, a virtual reality based e-commerce logistics distribution path display system is designed. Based on the hardware of the current path display system, the logistics vehicle positioning module using GIS and GPRS is designed, and the interaction between the system and users is realized by using the body sense interactive equipment and VR glasses. Based on the designed system hardware, the software part of the system is designed. According to the time difference of signal transmission, the positioning data of logistics distribution is corrected, and the 3D modeling software is used to establish the background of path display and complete the design of e-commerce logistics distribution path display.

As the virtual environment's quality of rendering fidelity increases dramatically, it leads to the neglect or simplification of the physical environment. This paper presents an experiment that explored the effects of an elevated physical platform with a virtually heightened environment to induce stress. Fifteen participants experienced four different conditions of varying physical and virtual heights. Participants reported significantly higher stress level when physically elevated regardless of the virtual height, which suggests that the inherent elevation will induce more stress within participants.",,978-1-6654-4057-8,10.1109/VRW52623.2021.00116,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419310,Human-centered computing;Virtual Reality;Height Exposure;Passive Haptic Feedback,Three-dimensional displays;Conferences;Virtual reality;User interfaces;Rendering (computer graphics);Haptic interfaces;Reliability,rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality,stressful physical environment;virtual reality height exposure;virtual environment;elevated physical platform;virtually heightened environment;physical heights;virtual heights;higher stress level,,2.0,,11.0,IEEE,6 May 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,29,"{'virtual', 'reality'}",2

VR has the capacity to create profoundly engaging experiences by synthesizing highly detailed sensory input in real time, making games the most obvious applications of VR. While the promises of VR may be exciting due to the problems it can solve and new experiences it can offer, there are still numerous issues to be addressed in order to achieve maximal immersion in VR. In this paper, we present the issues encountered during open testing of our applications on commercially available VR goggles and hand input device. The inability to effectively use the hands and feet to control and navigate the environment degrades the level of immersion of VR.
