We hypothesized that the integration of a smart wristband in a VR experience, provide a reliable and comfortable enough setup to add a biofeedback loop to a game. We created a physiologically enhanced game and coupled it with a smart wristband capable of monitoring one's heart rate. We tested our game with and without biofeedback and compared the reported novelty. We observed a high interest of the participants for the integration of smart wearables in VR.

Despite its promise, peoples' actual needs concerning the advanced uses of MR are less studied. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted two focus group user studies in which we explored people's perceptions, expectations, and ideas concerning remote interpersonal MR communication and collaboration. In the first study we examined people's perceptions of MR and the study participants collaboratively created 21 scenarios for MR communication. For the second study, the most promising of these scenarios were selected and refined to develop three different types of scenarios one with emotional content, one emphasizing entertainment and one focused on work-related situations. The scenarios were evaluated by the participants of the second study in the context of a specific MR communication system that uses near-eye displays. The results indicate that the expected advantages of MR in communication are its efficiency, richness and the increased feeling of presence over distance. However, concerns were raised about the technical reliability, usability and accessibility of advanced MR applications.

Twelve participants learned multi-level virtual buildings using three VE conditions (physical rotation HMD, physical rotation desktop and imagined rotation desktop). They were then tested on four cross-level tasks, including: pointing, route navigation, vertical navigation, and paper-based drilling. Results showed that performance on between-floor trials was reliably worse than for within-floor trials and that this difference was neither improved by the level of immersion of the display nor the rotation behavior used during navigation. Our data suggest that increasing the fidelity of these interface variables does not yield more accurate development of multi-level cognitive maps. Indeed, multi-level indoor wayfinding performance was as effective with the simplest and least expensive desktop display based purely on joystick navigation as the more complex VE platforms. These findings show that spatial cognition research in multi-level virtual buildings need not be limited to immersive VEs with physical body rotation which require considerable equipment cost and increased technical complexity.",Proceedings of the Fifth ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Indoor Spatial Awareness,8-15,8,"{'immersion', 'virtual'}","Orlando, florida",ISA '13,29,2

The system integrates an edge server that uses scalable 360¬∞ tiling to adaptively split the present 360¬∞ view of a VR user into a panoramic baseline content layer and a viewport-specific enhancement content layer. The user is then served the two content layers over complementary WiFi and VLC wireless links such that the delivered viewport quality is maximized for the given WiFi and VLC transmission resources. We formally characterize the actions of the server using rate-distortion optimization that we solve at low complexity. To account for the users' mobility as they explore different 360¬∞ viewpoints of the 6DOF remote scene content and maintain reliable high-quality VLC connectivity, we explore dynamic VLC transmitter steering and assignment in the system as graph bottleneck matching that aims to maximize the received VLC SNR across all users. We formulate an effective low-complexity solution to this discrete combinatorial optimization problem of high complexity. The paper also contributes a first actual 6DOF body and head movement VR navigation dataset that we collected and facilitate to assess the performance of our system via simulation experiments.

Implicit behavior from users, such as hand or gaze movements, might provide additional signals to improve the reliability of input. In this paper, the primary goal is to improve the detection of a selection gesture in VR during point-and-click interaction. Thus, we propose and investigate the use of information contained within the hand motion dynamics that precede a selection gesture. We built two models that classified if a user is likely to perform a selection gesture at the current moment in time. We collected data during a pointing-and-selection task from 15 participants and trained two models with different architectures, i.e., a logistic regression classifier was trained using predefined hand motion features and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) classifier was trained using raw hand motion data. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation PR-AUCs of 0.36 and 0.90 were obtained for each model respectively, demonstrating that the models performed well above chance (=0.13). The TCN model was found to improve the precision of a noisy selection gesture by 11.2% without sacrificing recall performance.

Prior work has suggested that user gaze patterns following an input event could be used to detect input recognition errors and subsequently improve interaction. However, to be useful, error detection systems would need to detect various types of high-cost errors. Furthermore, to build a reliable detection model for errors, gaze behaviour following these errors must be manifested consistently across different tasks. Using data analysis and machine learning models, this research examined gaze dynamics following input events in virtual reality (VR). Across three distinct point-and-select tasks, we found differences in user gaze patterns following three input events: correctly recognized input actions, input recognition errors, and user errors. These differences were consistent across tasks, selection versus deselection actions, and naturally occurring versus experimentally injected input recognition errors. A multi-class deep neural network successfully discriminated between these three input events using only gaze dynamics, achieving an AUC-ROC-OVR score of 0.78.

Interactions are often performed in a one-to-one mapping between the movements of the user‚Äôs real body, for instance, the hands, and the displayed body of the avatar. However, VR also allows manipulating this mapping to introduce non-isomorphic techniques. In this context, research on manipulations of virtual hand movements typically focuses on increasing the user‚Äôs interaction space to improve the overall efficiency of hand-based interactions. In this paper, we investigate a hand retargeting method for decelerated hand movements. With this technique, users need to perform larger movements to reach for an object in the VE, which can be utilized, for example, in therapeutic applications. If these gain-based redirections of virtual hand movements are small enough, users become unable to reliably detect them due to the dominance of the visual sense. In a psychophysical experiment, we analyzed detection thresholds for six different motion paths in mid-air for both hands.

Current architectures focus on delivering high performance at low cost; lifetime device reliability is a secondary concern. As the rate of permanent hardware faults increases, robustness will become a first class constraint for even low-cost systems. Current research into reliable architectures has focused on ad-hoc solutions to improve designs without altering their centralized control logic. Unfortunately, this centralized control presents a single point of failure, which limits long-term robustness.To address this issue, we introduce Viper, an architecture built from a redundant collection of fine-grained hardware components. Instructions are perceived as customers that require a sequence of services in order to properly execute. The hardware components vie to perform what services they can, dynamically forming virtual pipelines that avoid defective hardware. This is done using distributed control logic, which avoids a single point of failure by construction.Viper can tolerate a high number of permanent faults due to its inherent redundancy. As fault counts increase, its performance degrades more gracefully than traditional centralized-logic architectures. We estimate that fault rates higher than one permanent faults per 12 million transistors, on average, cause the throughput of a classic CMP design to fall below that of a Viper design of similar size.",Proceedings of the 39th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture,344-355,12,"{'reliability', 'virtual'}","Portland, Oregon",ISCA '12,29,2

PI (the illusion of being in a place) and Psi (the illusion that the depicted events are actually happening) were proposed by Slater as orthogonal components of virtual experience which contribute to realistic response in a VE. To that end, we identified characteristics of a virtual reality experience that we expected to influence one or the other of PI and Psi. We designed two experiments in which each participant experienced a given VE in one of four conditions chosen from a 2\texttimes{}2 design: high or low levels of PI-eliciting characteristics (that is, immersion) and high or low levels of Psi-eliciting characteristics. Following Skarbez, we use the term ""coherence"" for those characteristics which contribute to Psi, parallel to the use of ""immersion"" for characteristics that contribute to PI. We collected both questionnaire-based and physiological metrics. Several existing presence questionnaires could not reliably distinguish the effects of PI from those of Psi. They did, however, indicate that high levels of PI-eliciting characteristics and Psi-eliciting characteristics together result in higher presence, compared any of the other three conditions. This suggests that ""breaks in PI"" and ""breaks in Psi"" belong to a broader category of ""breaks in experience,"" any of which result in a degraded user experience. Participants' heart rates, however, responded markedly differently in the two Psi conditions; no such difference was observed across the PI conditions. This indicates that a VE that exhibits unusual or confusing behavior can cause stress in a user that affects physiological responses, and that one must take care to eliminate such confusing behaviors if one is using physiological measurement as a proxy for subjective experience in a VE.",Proceedings of the 24th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology,,11,"{'immersion', 'virtual'}","Tokyo, Japan",VRST '18,29,2

These explicit feedback mechanisms can be viewed as noisy measurements of both information reliability and information source trustworthiness. Can we leverage these noisy measurements, often biased, to distill a robust, unbiased and interpretable measure of both notions?In this paper, we argue that the large volume of digital traces left by the users within knowledge repositories also reflect information reliability and source trustworthiness. In particular, we propose a temporal point process modeling framework which links the temporal behavior of the users to information reliability and source trustworthiness. Furthermore, we develop an efficient convex optimization procedure to learn the parameters of the model from historical traces of the evaluations provided by these users. Experiments on real-world data gathered from Wikipedia and Stack Overflow show that our modeling framework accurately predicts evaluation events, provides an interpretable measure of information reliability and source trustworthiness, and yields interesting insights about real-world events.",Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web,847-855,9,"{'reliability', 'trustworthiness'}","Perth, Australia",WWW '17,29,2

However, building robust VR systems that use depth cameras are challenging. Gesture recognition accuracy is affected by occlusion, variation in hand orientation and misclassification of similar hand gestures. This research explores the limits of the Leap Motion depth camera for static hand pose recognition in virtual reality applications. We propose a system for analysing static hand poses and for systematically identifying a pose set that can achieve a near-perfect recognition accuracy. The system consists of a hand pose taxonomy, a pose notation, a machine learning classifier and an algorithm to identify a reliable pose set that can achieve near perfect accuracy levels. We used this system to construct a benchmark hand pose data set containing 2550 static hand pose instances, and show how the algorithm can be used to systematically derive a set of poses that can produce an accuracy of 99% using a Support Vector Machine classifier.",Conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists 2020,210-216,7,"{'virtual', 'reality'}","Cape Town, South Africa",SAICSIT '20,29,2

We developed a device that can present the facial expressions of a virtual agent together with providing tactile information from the movement of internal weights. Using this device, we conducted a pilot test to investigate how the trustworthiness of the virtual agent changed when the haptic information from the movement of the internal weights was added to the expression of the virtual agent.",Proceedings of the 2022 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,844-846,3,"{'virtual', 'credibility'}","Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan",HRI '22,29,2
