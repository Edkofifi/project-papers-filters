The potential of this technology has also been noticed in recreational physical activity and sports. It appears that a virtual environment can also be used in diagnosing certain psychomotor abilities. The main aim of this study consisted of assessing the relevance and reliability of VR-implemented tests of simple and complex reaction time (RT) performed by mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters. Thirty-two professional MMA fighters were tested. The original test developed in the virtual environment was applied for RT assessment. The fighters’ task consisted of reacting to the lighting up of a virtual disc situated in front of them by pushing a controller button. The relevance of the test task was estimated by juxtaposing the obtained results with the classic computer test used for measuring simple and complex reactions, while its reliability was assessed with the intraclass correlation procedure. Significant relationships found between the results of VR-implemented tests and computer-based tests confirmed the relevance of the new tool for the assessment of simple and complex RT. In the context of their reliability, RT tests in VR do not differ from tests conducted with the use of standard computer-based tools. VR technology enables the creation of tools that are useful in diagnosing psychomotor abilities. Reaction time tests performed by MMA fighters with the use of VR can be considered relevant, and their reliability is similar to the reliability obtained in computer-based tests. © 2022 by the authors.

Neck pain, one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases, affects 222 million people worldwide. The cervical range of motion (CROM) is a tool used to assess the neck’s state across three movement axes: flexo-extension, rotation, and lateral flexion. People with neck pain often have a reduced CROM, and they feel pain at the end-range and/or accompany neck movements with compensatory trunk movements. Virtual reality (VR) setups can track the movement of the head and other body parts in order to create the sensation of immersion in the virtual environment. Using this tracking position information, a CROM assessment can be performed using a VR setup that may be carried out autonomously from the user’s home. The objectives of this study were to develop a VR experience that could be used to perform a CROM assessment, and to evaluate the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the CROM measures guided by this VR experience. To the best of our knowledge, a study of this type has not been carried out before. Materials &amp; Methods. A total of 30 asymptomatic adults were assessed using a VR device (HTC Vive Pro EyeTM). Two raters provided support with the VR setup, and the participants were guided by the VR experience as they performed the movements. Each rater tested each subject twice, in random order. In addition to a head-mounted display (HMD), a tracker located on the subject’s back was used to measure trunk compensatory movements. The CROM was estimated using only the HMD position and this measurement was corrected using the tracker data. The mean and standard deviation were calculated to characterize the CROM. To evaluate the reliability, the interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for intra-rater and inter-rater analysis. The standard error of measurement and minimum detectable change were also calculated. The usability of the VR system was measured using the Spanish version of the System Usability Scale. Results. The mean CROM values in each axis of movement were compatible with those described in the literature. ICC values ranged between 0.86 and 0.96 in the intra-rater analysis and between 0.83 and 0.97 in the inter-rater analysis; these values were between good and excellent. When applying the correction of the trunk movements, both the intra-rater and inter-rater ICC values slightly worsened except in the case of the lateral flexion movement, where they slightly improved. The usability score of the CROM assessment/VR system was 86 points, which is an excellent usability score. Conclusion. The reliability of the measurements and the usability of the system indicate that a VR setup can be used to assess CROM. The reliability of the VR setup can be affected by slippage of the HMD or tracker. Both slippage errors are additive, i.e., only when the sum of these two errors is less than the compensatory movement do the measurements improve when considering the tracker data. © 2022 Santos-Paz et al.",Cervical range of motion;

In the midst of this universe, the concept, already well known, of mixed reality has established itself as a distinct paradigm. However, and contrary to augmented and virtual realities, there is not a clear and one definition of what it is exactly and why it is different from the other concepts. In this article, we attempt to provide a new classification method to standardize the definition of virtual, augmented and mixed realities. First, a quick overview of existing taxonomies is made, then we present our classification which is based on three criteria we called 3iVClass (Immersion, Interaction, Information). Finally, in order to verify its reliability, we used this classification to propose a definition of mixed reality. © 2018 The Authors.

Engineering “Enzo Ferrari”, Italy","Human-centred design is based on the satisfaction of the user needs related to performances, aesthetics, reliability, usability, accessibility and visibility issues, costs, and many other aspects. The combination of all these aspects has been called as “perceived quality”, that is definitely a transdisciplinary topic. However, the “real” perceived quality is usually faithfully assessed only at the end of the design process, while it is very difficult to predict on 3D CAD model. In this context, digital manufacturing tools and virtual simulation technologies can be validly used according to a transdisciplinary approach to create interactive digital mock-ups where the human-system interaction can be simulated and the perceived quality assessed in advance. The paper proposes a mixed reality (MR) set-up where systems and humans interacting with them are digitalized and monitored to easily evaluate the human-machine interaction. It is useful to predict the design criticalities and to improve the global system design. An industrial case study has been developed in collaboration with CNH Industrial to demonstrate how the proposed set-up can be validly used to support human-centred design. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.",Digital manufacturing; Human-centred design; Human-machine interaction; Virtual simulation,Man machine systems; Manufacture; Mixed reality; Tractors (agricultural); Digital manufacturing; Human centred design; Human machine interaction; Human-system interaction; Industrial case study; Perceived quality; Trans-disciplinary approaches; Virtual simulations; Computer aided design,"Ergonomics of human system interaction-Part 210: Human-centered design for interactive systems, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (2009) ISO, pp. 9241-10210; Stramler, J.H., (1993) The Dictionary for Human Factors/Ergonomics, , CRC Press, Boca Raton; Pheasant, S., Space, B., Anthropometry, Ergonomics and the Design of Work (1999) Taylor & Francis, Philadelphia, pp. 121-123. , pp; Peruzzini, M., Pellicciari, M., A framework to design a human-centred adaptive manufacturing system for aging workers (2017) Advanced Engineering Informatics, 33, pp. 330-349. , Vol., pp; Wilson, J.R., Fundamentals of ergonomics in theory and practice (2000) Applied Ergonomics, 31, pp. 557-567. , Vol., pp; Peruzzini, M., Pellicciari, M., A human factors assessment model for sustainable manufacturing (2017) In Int.

VR is usually classified according to the level of user immersion achieved. VR has attracted increasing attention between academic and practitioners during the last decade due to technological progresses that achieved high reliability and relatively low cost. VR potential to visualize information, replace physical presence and stimulate interaction make of this technology an essential part in the toolbox of future engineers. Higher Education Institution must align their curricula to fulfill this purpose. At the same time VR can be a support to enhance the learning process itself. This work analyses the impact of fully-immersive VR technology on an average production engineering curricula based on the educational offer at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The results show that VR has a great potential to shape the production engineering curricula in the coming years both in term of content and design of the learning experiences. © 2019 IEEE.",education; fully-immersive virtual reality; production engineering,"Curricula; Engineering education; Production; High reliability; Higher education institutions; Immersive virtual reality; Learning experiences; Potential impacts; Royal Institute of Technology; Stockholm , Sweden; Technological progress; Virtual reality","Psotka, J., Immersive training systems: Virtual reality and education and training (1995) Instructional Science, 23 (5-6), pp. 405-431; Mujber, T.S., Szecsi, T., Hashmi, M.S., Virtual reality applications in manufacturing process simulation (2004) Journal of Materials Processing Technology, 155, pp. 1834-1838; Robertson, G.G., Card, S.K., MacKinlay, J.D., Three views of virtual reality: Nonimmersive virtual reality (1993) Computer, 26 (2), p. 81; Roussou, M., Learning by doing and learning through play: An exploration of interactivity in virtual environments for children (2004) Computers in Entertainment (CIE), 2 (1), p. 10; Garris, R., Ahlers, R., Driskell, J.E., Games, motivation, and learning: A research and practice model (2002) Simulation & Gaming, 33 (4), pp. 441-467; Schaefer, D., Borgmann, C., Scheffter, D., Factory planning and the potential of virtual reality (2001) Proceedings of Avrii & Convr, pp. 92-98; Dangelmaier, W., Virtual and augmented reality support for discrete manufacturing system simulation (2005) Computers in Industry, 56 (4), pp. 371-383; Ong, S.K., Yeh, A., Nee, C., Virtual and augmented reality applications in manufacturing (2013) Springer Science & Business Media; Bayliss, A.B.G.M., Taylor, R.I., Willis, P.J., Virtual manufacturing (1994) Csg 94-Set Theoretic Modelling Techniques and Applications, pp. 13-14; Jayaram, H.C.S., Lyons, K., Virtual assembly using virtual reality techniques (1997) Comp.

Importantly, VR is a promising modality for healthcare, where treatment efficacy has been recognized for a range of conditions. It is equally valuable across wider research disciplines. However, there is a lack of suitable criteria and consistent terminology with which to define VR technology. A considerable number of studies have misclassified VR hardware (e.g. defining laptops as VR), hindering validity and research comparisons. This review addresses these limitations and establishes a standardized VR qualification framework. As a result of a comprehensive theoretical and literature review, the hardware-based VR qualification matrix is proposed. The matrix criteria consist of (1) three-dimensional (3D) synchronized sensory stimulation; (2) degrees of freedom tracking; and (3) visual suppression of physical stimuli. To validate the model and quantify the current scale/diversity of VR misclassification, a 2019 sectional review of health-related studies was conducted. Of the 115 studies examined against standardized criteria, 35.7% utilized VR, 31.3% misclassified VR, 18.3% were considered quasi-VR, and 14.8% omitted critical specifications. The proposed model demonstrates good validity and reliability for qualifying and classifying VR. Key Practitioner Messages Virtual reality (VR) therapy has gained rapid empirical support, although many practitioners do not understand the difference between genuine and less-realistic VR variations. That has resulted from an evident lack of suitable criteria to define VR across a range of studies and protocols. Our proposed hardware-based virtual reality qualification matrix addresses issues to do with misclassification, via the introduction of standardised criteria. Applying the matrix to existing literature has revealed that more than 30% of VR studies use hardware that does not fit the high standards of rigour required for immersion in a simulated space. The model is a practical tool researchers and practitioners can use to quality and verify VR standards across research studies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",immersion; virtual reality; virtual reality classification; virtual reality qualification; virtual reality technology,human; reproducibility; technology; virtual reality; virtual reality exposure therapy; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Technology; Virtual Reality; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy,"Agrawal, A.K., Robertson, S., Litwin, L., Tringale, E., Treadwell, M., Hoppe, C., Marsh, A., Virtual reality as complementary pain therapy in hospitalized patients with sickle cell disease (2019) Pediatric Blood & Cancer, 66 (2). , https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.27525; Ahmadi, H.S., Mehraban, A.H., Amini, M., Sheikhi, M., The effects of virtual reality on upper limb function in chronic stroke patients: A clinical trial (2019) Iranian Rehabilitation Journal, 17 (1), pp. 81-89. , https://doi.org/10.32598/irj.17.1.89; Alemanno, F., Houdayer, E., Emedoli, D., Locatelli, M., Mortini, P., Mandelli, C., Raggi, A., Iannaccone, S., Efficacy of virtual reality to reduce chronic low back pain: Proof-of-concept of a non-pharmacological approach on pain, quality of life, neuropsychological and functional outcome (2019) PLoS ONE, 14 (5). , https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216858; Alshatrat, S.M., Alotaibi, R., Sirois, M., Malkawi, Z., The use of immersive virtual reality for pain control during periodontal scaling and root planing procedures in dental hygiene clinic (2019) International Journal of Dental Hygiene, 17 (1), pp. 71-76. , https://doi.org/10.1111/idh.12366; Arnoni, J.L.B., Pavão, S.L., dos Santos Silva, F.P., Rocha, N.A.C.F., Effects of virtual reality in body oscillation and motor performance of children with cerebral palsy: A preliminary randomized controlled clinical trial (2019) Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice, 35, pp. 189-194. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2019.02.014; Bai, H., Nassani, A., Ens, B., Billinghurst, M., Asymmetric bimanual interaction for mobile virtual reality (2017) ICAT-EGVE, pp. 83-86. , https://doi.org/10.2312/egve.20171343; Bailenson, J.A., (2018) Experience on demand: What virtual reality is, how it works, and what it can do, , First ed., W.

However, currently there are not many continuous performance tools based on virtual reality (VR) for measuring attentional capacity in adults. The present study aimed to obtain normative data for the Nesplora Aquarium VR test in a Spanish population, looking at sex and age variables. In addition, this study also aimed to analyze the psychometric properties of the tool such as scale, internal consistency, and item difficulty and discrimination indices. A total of 1,469 participants from different regions of Spain (57.6% female) with ages ranging from 16 to 90 years old took part in this normative study. Nesplora Aquarium was developed in order to support clinicians in the assessment of attentional processes and WM in adults over 16 years old. It is an 18-minute individual test performed through a VR system. The system provides better visual and auditory immersion in the task than computerized CPTs. This study revealed that the new VR tool, designed to measure adult attention and working memory levels, exhibited good psychometric properties related to reliability and internal consistency. In addition, item difficulty and discrimination values were also acceptable. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Adults; attention; continuous performance test; diagnosis; virtual reality,"adolescent; adult; aged; attention; female; human; male; middle aged; neuropsychological test; reproducibility; short term memory; very elderly; virtual reality; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Virtual Reality; Young Adult","Ajilchi, B., Nejati, V., Executive function in students with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (2017) Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Journal, 8 (3), pp. 223-232; Albrecht, B., Sandersleben, H., Wiedmann, K., Rothenberger, A., ADHD history of the concept: The case of the continuous performance test (2015) Current Developmental Disorders Reports, 2 (1), pp. 10-22; Amador, J.A., Forns, M., Kirchner, T., (2006) Repertorios cognoscitivos de atención, percepción y memoria.

We define the errors as measurements of hand placement accuracy and consistency within bimanual movement of an interactive virtual object. First, a study is presented which illustrates the amount of variability between the hands and the mean distance of the hands from the surfaces of a common virtual object. The results allow a discussion of the most significant factors which should be considered in the frame of developing realistic mixed reality interaction systems. The degree of error was found to be independent of interaction speed, whilst the size of virtual object and the position of the hands are significant. Second, a further study illustrates how perceptible these errors are to a third person viewer of the interaction (e.g. an audience member). We found that interaction errors arising from the overestimation of an object surface affected the visual credibility for the viewer considerably more than an underestimation of the object. This work is presented within the application of a real-time Interactive Virtual Television Studio, which offers convincing realtime interaction for live TV production. We believe the results and methodology presented here could also be applied for designing, implementing and assessing interaction quality in many other Mixed Reality applications. © 2014 IEEE.",Interaction Framework; Interactive Virtual Studios; Mixed Reality; Performance Measurement,Augmented reality; Errors; Interaction framework; Interaction quality; Interaction speed; Interaction systems; Mixed reality; Performance measurements; Real time interactions; Virtual Studio; Virtual reality,"Lee, T., Hollerer, T., Handy ar: Markerless inspection of augmented reality objects using fingertip tracking (2007) 11th IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers, pp. 83-90; Hough, G., Athwal, C., Williams, I., ScaMP: A head guided projection system (2012) ACM Designing Interactive Systems, , p. poster/2 page paper; Hough, G., Athwal, C., Williams, I., Advanced occlusion handling for virtual studios (2012) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, p. 7425; Hough, G., (2013), www.youtube.com/user/GPHResearch, [Accessed 12 01 2014]; Minoh, M., Obara, H., Funtatomi, T., Toyoura, M., Kakusho, K., Direct manipulation of 3D virtual objects by actors (2007) Informatics Research for Development of Knowledge Society Infrastructure, pp. 11-18; Bowman, D., Johnson, D., Hodges, L., Testbed evaluation of virtual environment interaction (1999) Proc. of VRST99, pp. 26-33; Teather, R., Stuerzlinger, W., Guidelines for 3D positioning techniques (2007) Proc. of the 2007 Conference on Future Play, pp. 61-68; Sutcliffe, A., Gault, B., Heuristic evaluation of virtual reality applications (2004) Interacting with Computers, 16, pp. 831-849; Kim, N., Woo, W., Kim, G., Park, C.-M., 3D virtual studio for natural inter-acting (2006) IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, 36 (4), pp. 758-773; Woldecke, B., Vierjahn, T., Flasko, M., Herder, J., Geiger, C., Steering actors through a virtual set employing vibrotactile feedback (2009) Third International Conference on Tangible Embedded Interaction; Woldecke, B., Marinos, D., Herder, J., Geiger, C., Vibrotactile pitfalls: Armguidence for moderators in virtual TV studios (2010) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Humans and Computers, pp. 72-80; Fukaya, T., An effective interaction tool for performance in the virtual studio-invisible light projection system (2003) NHK Science & Technical Research Lab; (2012) Methodology for the Subjective Assessment of the Quality of Television Pictures, , ITU-R BT. 500-13; McNally, D., Perceptual video quality and blockiness metrics for multimedia streaming applications (2001) Proc.

Participants were classified by amblyogenic risk factor (24 anisometropic, 25 strabismic and 30 mixed) and, for those with strabismus, also by refractive response (16 accommodative and 39 non-accommodative). We characterized our sample using three variables, called the ‘triplet’ henceforth: interocular acuity difference, stereoacuity and imbalance factor. Binocular imbalance showed high test-retest reliability (no significant difference between test and retest in a subgroup, n = 20, p = 0.831); was correlated with Worth 4 dots test (r = 0.538, p<0.0001); and correlated with both interocular acuity difference (r = 0.575, p<0.0001) and stereoacuity (r = 0.675, p<0.0001). The mean values of each variable of the triplet differed depending on group classification. Mixed and non-accommodative groups showed the worst mean values compared with the other groups. Among participants with strabismus, strabismic vs mixed subgroups did not show significant differences in any variable of the triplet, whereas the accommodative vs non-accommodative subgroups showed significant differences in all of them. According to a univariate logistic model, any variable of the triplet provides a good metric for differentiating patients from controls, except for binocular imbalance for anisometropic subgroup. The proposed binocular imbalance test is feasible and reliable. We recommend monitoring amblyopia clinically not only considering visual acuity, but also stereoacuity and interocular imbalance. Stereoacuity on its own fails because of the high percentage of patients with no measurable stereoacuity. Binocular imbalance may help to fill that gap. © 2020 Martín et al.

Users have different level of skills when it comes to using VR. Therefore, handcrafting rule-based robust behaviour interaction that adapts to varying abilities of users is an ongoing challenge. In this study, the potential of using a data-driven method allowing researchers to gain insight into user behavioural data is investigated. A VR data replay and annotation method that allows for the analysis and classification of VR collected data through a graphical user interface is introduced.

Indeed, coupling BIM with mixed reality can speed up and improve the quality of the renovation design processes, because it can display virtual models of alternative design scenarios superimposed over the existing physical facility. To this purpose, a sample of technicians was enrolled to test the reliability of this technology. A prototype was developed that enables cooperation among stakeholders and the implementation of an efficient workflow. The volunteers carried out real-life tests in a building demonstrator in Caceres (Spain) and filled in two questionnaires with their feedback. The results showed that an MR-based platform can involve interested stakeholders in the assessment of renovation design projects, that speeds up the decision-making process and increases the quality of those projects. Moreover, technicians can master the technology quickly, provided that it is included in the current renovation workflow and some technology gaps are covered. However, the main limitations of this study are that these findings are valid for building renovation design only, and the tests were performed in a controlled, yet full scale, experimental environment. Finally, this paper deals with a few open technical issues, such as the efficient alignment of holograms, transformation of BIM models into a format suitable for mixed reality applications and sharing feedbacks in an on-line repository to foster collaboration. © 2022 by the authors.",BIM; building renovation; mixed reality; MR reliability; real-life tests; sustainable design; user acceptance,assessment method; building; management practice; sustainability; testing method; Caceres [Extremadura]; Extremadura; Spain,"(2021) Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on ENERGY Efficiency, Amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and Repealing Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC, , http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2012/27/oj, Available online; (2018) Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 Amending Directive 2012/27/EU on Energy Efficiency, , http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2018/2002/oj, Available online; Sandberg, N.H., Sartori, I., Heidrich, O., Dawson, R., Dascalaki, E., Dimitriou, S., Vimm-r, T., Šijanec Zavrl, M., Dynamic building stock modelling: Application to 11 European countries to support the energy efficiency and retrofit ambitions of the EU (2016) Energy Build, 132, pp. 26-38; Artola, I., Rademaekers, K., Williams, R., Yearwood, J., Boosting Building Renovation: What Potential and Value for Europe.

And in the context of virtual community, this paper explores information quality, source credibility two antecedents of information adoption, and reconstructs their new dimensions through qualitative research. EWOM information quality is composed of vividness, appropriate amount, reliability, relevance, guidance and interactivity. Source credibility is composed of trustworthiness, popularity and community status.

Visual-perceptive and visual-cognitive functions are degraded by neurological disorders and brain damage, but are improved by vision training, e.g. in athletes. Hence, developing tools to evaluate/improve visuomotor abilities has found echo among psychologists, neurophysiologists, clinicians and sport professionals. Here we implemented the Dynavision visuomotor reaction task in virtual reality (VR) to get a flexible tool to place high demands on visual-perceptive and visual-cognitive processes, and explore individual abilities in visuomotor integration. First, we demonstrated high test–retest reliability for the task in VR among healthy physically-active students (n = 64, 32 females). Second, the capture of head movements thanks to the VR-headset sensors provided new and reliable information on individual visual-perceptual strategies, which added significant value to explore visuomotor phenotypes. A factor analysis of mixed data and hierarchical clustering on principal components points to head movements, video-games practice and ball-tracking sports as critical cues to draw visuomotor phenotypes among our participants. We conclude that the visuomotor task in VR is a reliable, flexible and promising tool. Since VR nowadays can serve e.g. to modulate multisensorial integration by creating visual interoceptive-exteroceptive conflicts, or placing specifically designed cognitive demand, much could be learned on complex integrated visuomotor processes through VR experiments. This offers new perspectives for post brain injury risk evaluation, rehabilitation programs and visual-cognitive training. © 2021, The Author(s).",,adult; association; brain injury; cognition; female; head; human; learning; male; movement (physiology); phenotype; physiology; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; sport; video game; virtual reality; vision; young adult; Adult; Brain Injuries; Cognition; Cues; Female; Head; Humans; Learning; Male; Movement; Phenotype; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Sports; Video Games; Virtual Reality; Visual Perception; Young Adult,"Stone, S.A., Visual field advantage: Redefined by training?

However, efforts to probe the role of students’ learning traits such as motivated strategies for learning in their IVR learning have been limited. Most studies commonly analyzed learners’ perceptions of immersion with a single construct rather than with multiple constructs. Therefore, this study implemented immersive virtual field trips for science learning in three elementary classes (a total of 76 students) for understanding how students’ inherent self-efficacy, intrinsic value and self-regulation for science learning related to their perceived immersion (ie, basic attention, temporal dissociation, transportation, emotional involvement, enjoyment) and attitudes (ie, perceived usefulness and behaviors of IVR learning) when engaging in IVR learning environments. The reliability and validity of the constructs in the PLS-SEM path modeling were first confirmed. This study further identified that motivation of intrinsic value and self-regulation may play a dominant role in the students’ learning attitudes in IVR environments for science education. It was also verified that the students’ immersive experiences of attention and enjoyment significantly mediated their IVR learning. Notably, the students with lower levels of self-efficacy may have been more immersed in IVR environments and further held positive learning attitudes. The findings of this study have implications for practicing IVR-related learning activities in elementary classrooms with considerations of learners’ psychological characteristics and perceived immersion when confronting IVR technology. © 2020 British Educational Research Association",,Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Deregulation; E-learning; Least squares approximations; Students; Elementary classrooms; Immersive virtual reality; Learning environments; Motivational beliefs; Partial least squares analysis; Perceived usefulness; Psychological characteristics; Reliability and validity; Virtual reality,"Alrehaili, E.A., Al Osman, H., A virtual reality role-playing serious game for experiential learning (2019) Interactive Learning Environments, pp. 1-14; Amin, A., Gromala, D., Tong, X., Shaw, C., Immersion in cardboard VR compared to a traditional head-mounted display (2016) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pp. 269-276; Boda, P.A., Brown, B., Priming urban learners' attitudes toward the relevancy of science: A mixed-methods study testing the importance of context (2019) Journal of Research in Science Teaching; Brown, E., Cairns, P., A grounded investigation of game immersion (2004) CHI'04 extended abstracts on human factors in computing systems, pp. 1297-1300. , New York, NY, ACM; Burdea, G.C., Coiffet, P., (2003) Virtual reality technology, , 2nd ed., Hoboken, NJ, John Wiley & Sons; Burns, C.G., Fairclough, S.H., Use of auditory event-related potentials to measure immersion during a computer game (2015) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 73, pp. 107-114; Cai, S., Liu, E., Yang, Y., Liang, J., Tablet-based AR technology: Impacts on students’ conceptions and approaches to learning mathematics according to their self-efficacy (2019) British Journal of Educational Technology, 50 (1), pp. 248-263; Chai, C.S., Wong, L.H., King, R.B., Surveying and modeling students’ motivation and learning strategies for mobile-assisted seamless Chinese language learning (2016) Educational Technology & Society, 19 (3), pp. 170-180; Cheng, K.H., Reading an augmented reality book: An exploration of learners’ cognitive load, motivation, and attitudes (2017) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 33 (4), pp. 53-69; Cheng, K.H., Liang, J.C., Tsai, C.C., University students’ online academic help seeking: The role of self-regulation and information commitments (2013) Internet and Higher Education, 16, pp. 70-77; Cheng, K.H., Tsai, C.C., A case study of immersive virtual field trips in an elementary classroom: Students’ learning experience and teacher-student interaction behaviors (2019) Computers & Education, 140, p. 103600; Chin, W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling (1998) Modern methods for business research, pp. 295-336. , G.

In this study, we designed an innovative uninterrupted electromagnetic propulsion device for high-endurance missions of a quadcopter drone for the lucrative exploration of earth and other planets with atmospheres. As an airborne platform, this device could achieve scientific objectives better than state-of-the-art revolving spacecraft and walking robots, without any terrain limitation. We developed a mixed reality simulation based on a quadcopter drone and an X-Plane flight simulator. A computer with the X-Plane flight simulator represented the virtual part, and a real quadcopter operating within an airfield represented the real part. In the first phase of our study, we developed a connection interface between the X-Plane flight simulator and the quadcopter ground control station in MATLAB. The experimental results generated from the Earth's atmosphere show that the flight data from the real and the virtual quadcopters are precise and very close to the prescribed target. The proof-of-concept of the mixed reality simulation of the quadcopter at the Earth atmosphere was verified and validated through several experimental flights of the F450 spider quadcopter with a Pixhawk flight controller with the restricted endurance at the airfield location of Hangang Drone Park in Seoul, South Korea. We concluded that the new generation drones integrated with lightweight electromagnetic propulsion devices are a viable option for achieving unrestricted flight endurance with improved payload capability for Earth and other planetary explorations with the aid of mixed reality simulation to meet the mission flight path demands. This study provides insight into mixed reality simulation aiming for Mars explorations and high-endurance missions in the Earth's atmosphere with credibility using quadcopter drones regulated by dual-head electromagnetic propulsion devices. © 2020 by the authors.",Dual-head electromagnetic propulsion device; Mixed reality simulation; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Visualized ground control station; X-Plane flight simulator,,"Alkamachi, A., Ergelebi, E., A proportional derivative sliding mode control for an overactuated quadcopter (2018) Proc.

Despite its potential, the technology has yet to be used for the formal assessment of clinical competency. This study sought to collect validity evidence and assess the feasibility of using the HoloLens 2 mixed reality headset for the conduct and augmentation of Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs). Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted to compare the assessment of undergraduate medical students undertaking OSCEs via HoloLens 2 live (HLL) and recorded (HLR), and gold-standard in-person (IP) methods. An augmented mixed reality scenario was also assessed. Results: Thirteen undergraduate participants completed a total of 65 OSCE stations. Overall inter-modality correlation was 0.81 (p = 0.01), 0.98 (p = 0.01) and 0.82 (p = 0.01) for IP vs. HLL, HLL vs. HLR and IP vs. HLR respectively. Skill based correlations for IP vs. HLR were assessed for history taking (0.82, p = 0.01), clinical examination (0.81, p = 0.01), procedural (0.88, p = 0.01) and clinical skills (0.92, p = 0.01), and assessment of a virtual mixed reality patient (0.74, p = 0.01). The HoloLens device was deemed to be usable and practical (Standard Usability Scale (SUS) score = 51.5), and the technology was thought to deliver greater flexibility and convenience, and have the potential to expand and enhance assessment opportunities. Conclusions: HoloLens 2 is comparable to traditional in-person examination of undergraduate medical students for both live and recorded assessments, and therefore is a valid and robust method for objectively assessing performance. The technology is in its infancy, and users need to develop confidence in its usability and reliability as an assessment tool. However, the potential to integrate additional functionality including holographic content, automated tracking and data analysis, and to facilitate remote assessment may allow the technology to enhance, expand and standardise examinations across a range of educational contexts. © 2022, The Author(s).",Assessment; Innovation; Medical education; Mixed reality technology,"adult; anamnesis; article; clinical article; clinical examination; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis; feasibility study; female; gold standard; human; infancy; male; medical education; medical student; prospective study; reliability; skill; usability; validation study; validity; clinical competence; education; medical student; procedures; reproducibility; technology; Augmented Reality; Clinical Competence; Educational Measurement; Humans; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Students, Medical; Technology","Pennefather, P., Krebs, C., Exploring the Role of XR in Visualisations for Use in Medical Education (2019) Adv Exp Med Biol, 1171, pp. 15-23; Bogomolova, K., Sam, A., Misky, A., Development of a Virtual Three-Dimensional Assessment Scenario for Anatomical Education (2021) Anat Sci Educ, 14 (3), pp. 385-393; Gerup, J., Soerensen, C., Dieckmann, P., Augmented reality and mixed reality for healthcare education beyond surgery: an integrative review (2020) Int J Med Educ, 11, pp. 1-18; Wish-Baratz, S., Crofton, A., Gutierrez, J., Henninger, E., Griswold, M., Assessment of Mixed-Reality Technology Use in Remote Online Anatomy Education (2020) JAMA Netw Open, 3 (9); Ruthberg, J., Tingle, G., Tan, L., Mixed reality as a time-efficient alternative to cadaveric dissection (2020) Med Teach, 42 (8), pp. 896-901; Martin, G., Koizia, L., Kooner, A., Use of the HoloLens2 Mixed Reality Headset for Protecting Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective, Observational Evaluation (2020) J Med Internet Res, 22 (8); Mitsuno, D., Ueda, K., Hirota, Y., Ogino, M., Effective Application of Mixed Reality Device HoloLens (2019) Plast Reconstr Surg, 143 (2), pp. 647-651; Tepper, O., Rudy, H., Lefkowitz, A., Mixed Reality with HoloLens (2017) Plast Reconstr Surg, 140 (5), pp. 1066-1070; Kumar, N., Pandey, S., Rahman, E., A Novel Three-Dimensional Interactive Virtual Face to Facilitate Facial Anatomy Teaching Using Microsoft HoloLens (2021) Aesthetic Plast Surg, 45 (3), pp. 1005-1011; Maniam, P., Schnell, P., Dan, L., Exploration of temporal bone anatomy using mixed reality (HoloLens): development of a mixed reality anatomy teaching resource prototype (2019) J Vis Commun Med, 43 (1), pp. 17-26; Robinson, B., Mitchell, T., Brenseke, B., Evaluating the Use of Mixed Reality to Teach Gross and Microscopic Respiratory Anatomy (2020) Med Sci Educ, 30 (4), pp. 1745-1748; Schoeb, D., Schwarz, J., Hein, S., Mixed reality for teaching catheter placement to medical students: a randomized single-blinded, prospective trial (2020) BMC Med Educ, 20 (1), p. 510; Muangpoon, T., Haghighi Osgouei, R., Escobar-Castillejos, D., Kontovounisios, C., Bello, F., Augmented Reality System for Digital Rectal Examination Training and Assessment: System Validation (2020) J Med Internet Res, 22 (8); Balian, S., McGovern, S., Abella, B., Blewer, A., Leary, M., Feasibility of an augmented reality cardiopulmonary resuscitation training system for health care providers (2019) Heliyon, 5 (8); Microsoft Corporation 2021.

VR has the capacity to create profoundly engaging experiences by synthesizing highly detailed sensory input in real time, making games the most obvious applications of VR. While the promises of VR may be exciting due to the problems it can solve and new experiences it can offer, there are still numerous issues to be addressed in order to achieve maximal immersion in VR. In this paper, we present the issues encountered during open testing of our applications on commercially available VR goggles and hand input device. The inability to effectively use the hands and feet to control and navigate the environment degrades the level of immersion of VR. With users preferring reliability over intuitiveness, we explore the use of gaze as a substitute input device. Results of experiments conducted on numerous volunteers showed significant improvement in terms of user control. © 2016 IEEE.",Gesture Recognition; Head Gaze; User Interaction; Virtual Reality,Gesture recognition; Knobs; Head Gaze; Input devices; Interaction techniques; Real time; Sensory input; Technology companies; User control; User interaction; Virtual reality,"Pelz, J., Hayhoe, M., Loeber, R., The coordination of eye, head, and hand movements in a natural task (2001) Experimental Brain Research, 139 (3), pp. 266-277; Yu, C., Schermerhorn, P., Scheutz, M., Adaptive eye gaze patterns in interactions with human and artificial agents (2012) ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 1 (2), p. 13; Sutherland, I.E., The ultimate display (1965) Multimedia: From Wagner to Virtual Reality; Furness, T.A., The super cockpit and its human factors challenges (1986) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 30 (1), pp. 48-52. , SAGE Publications; (2014) Oculus Rift, , https://www.oculus.com/, [accessed: 2015-11-24]; (2015) The Best VR Headsets 2015, , http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/the-best-vr-headsets-2015-1292087, [accessed: 2015-11-24]; Barfield, W., (2015) Fundamentals of Wearable Computers and Augmented Reality, , CRC Press; Kato, K., Miyashita, H., Creating a mobile head-mounted display with proprietary controllers for interactive virtual reality content (2015) Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, pp. 35-36. , ACM; (2015) VR Best Practices Guidelines, , https://developer.leapmotion.com/vr-best-practices, 12 June.

Most VR simulators focus on learning technical skills and few on procedural skills. Studies that evaluated VR simulators focused on feasibility, reliability or easiness of use, but few of them used a specific acceptability measurement tool. Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess acceptability and usability of a new VR simulator for procedural skill training among scrub nurses, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Participants: The simulator training system was tested with a convenience sample of 16 non-expert users and 13 expert scrub nurses from the neurosurgery department of a French University Hospital. Methods: The scenario was designed to train scrub nurses in the preparation of the instrumentation table for a craniotomy in the operating room (OR). Results: Acceptability of the VR simulator was demonstrated with no significant difference between expert scrub nurses and non-experts. There was no effect of age, gender or expertise. Workload, immersion and simulator sickness were also rated equally by all participants. Most participants stressed its pedagogical interest, fun and realism, but some of them also regretted its lack of visual comfort. Conclusion: This VR simulator designed to teach surgical procedures can be widely used as a tool in initial or vocational training. © 2019",Acceptability; Nursing education; Procedural skills; VR simulator,"adult; clinical competence; computer interface; craniotomy; female; human; learning; male; nursing education; operating room personnel; procedures; reproducibility; simulation training; virtual reality; Adult; Clinical Competence; Craniotomy; Education, Nursing; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Operating Room Nursing; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality","Abboudi, H., Khan, M.S., Aboumarzouk, O., Guru, K.A., Challacombe, B., Dasgupta, P., Ahmed, K., Current status of validation for robotic surgery simulators - a systematic review: current status of validation for robotic surgery simulators (2013) BJU Int., 111 (2), pp. 194-205; Agarwal, R., Karahanna, E., Time ﬂies when you're having fun: cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage (2000) MIS Quarterly, 24 (4), pp. 665-694; Agha, R.A., Fowler, A.J., The role and validity of surgical simulation (2015) Int.

The use of non-verbal cues such as gestures, body movement, and facial expressions convey the feeling and the feedback to the user. This discipline of Human-Computer Interaction places reliance on the algorithmic robustness and the sensitivity of the sensor to ameliorate the recognition. Sensors play a significant role in accurate detection by providing a very high-quality input, hence increasing the efficiency and the reliability of the system. Automatic recognition of human emotions would help in teaching social intelligence in the machines. This paper presents a brief study of the various approaches and the techniques of emotion recognition. The survey covers a succinct review of the databases that are considered as data sets for algorithms detecting the emotions by facial expressions. Later, mixed reality device Microsoft HoloLens (MHL) is introduced for observing emotion recognition in Augmented Reality (AR). A brief introduction of its sensors, their application in emotion recognition and some preliminary results of emotion recognition using MHL are presented. The paper then concludes by comparing results of emotion recognition by the MHL and a regular webcam. © 2018 by the authors.

This high data rate over short transmission distances may be achieved via the abundant bandwidth in the terahertz (THz) band. However, THz waves experience severe signal attenuation, which may be compensated by the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology with programmable reflecting elements. Meanwhile, the low VR interaction latency can be achieved with the mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture due to its computation capabilities. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we propose an MEC-enabled and RIS-assisted THz VR network in an indoor scenario, by taking into account the uplink viewpoint prediction and position transmission, the MEC rendering, and the downlink transmission. We propose two methods, which are referred to as centralized online gated recurrent unit (GRU) and distributed federated averaging (FedAvg), to predict the viewpoints of the VR users. In the uplink, an algorithm that integrates online long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) is deployed to predict the locations and the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight statuses of the VR users over time. In the downlink, we develop a constrained deep reinforcement learning algorithm to select the optimal phase shifts of the RIS under latency constraints. Simulation results show that our proposed learning architecture achieves near-optimal QoE as that of the genie-aided benchmark algorithm, and about two times improvement in QoE compared to the random phase shift selection scheme. © 1983-2012 IEEE.",constrained deep reinforcement learning; convolutional neural network; reconfigurable intelligent surface; Terahertz transmission; virtual reality,Convolution; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Quality of service; Reinforcement learning; Rendering (computer graphics); Virtual reality; Constrained deep reinforcement learning; Convolutional neural network; Downlink; Prediction algorithms; Reconfigurable; Reconfigurable intelligent surface; Rendering (computer graphic); Streaming medium; Terahertz transmission; Uplink; Wireless communications; Mobile edge computing,"Bastug, E., Bennis, M., Médard, M., Debbah, M., Toward interconnected virtual reality: Opportunities, challenges, and enablers (2017) IEEE Commun.

The aim of our study is to investigate the needs and expectations of the potential users of a futuristic and a novel technology called Mobile Mixed Reality (MMR). Based on the users' impressions and expectations, we developed MMR prototypes representing various scenarios and contexts of use. We observed that the most important factors that play a role when it comes to acceptability are usefulness, personalization, reliability, and relevance. We developed different prototypes that were tested in order to evaluate the prototype acceptability. The understanding provided by the study helped in designing early MMR prototypes. The most intrusive elements that should be supported by any MMR application were found to be usefulness (how useful is the information to any individual), personalization (personify the information with such questions as what, how and when to receive any information), reliability (accuracy and authenticity of the presented information), and relevance (utility and value of the information). © 2012 IEEE.",mobile devices; Mobile mixed reality; prototyping; user expectation; user needs; user research,Immersive; Mixed reality; Personalizations; Physical environments; Potential users; User expectations; User need; User research; Information technology; Mobile devices; Software prototyping; Virtual reality,"Gartner Says Worldwide Mobile Device Sales to End Users Reached 1.6 Billion Units in 2010; Smartphone Sales Grew 72 Percent in 2010, , http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1543014; Bach, C., Scapin, D.L., Obstacles and Perspectives for Evaluating Mixed Reality Systems Usability (2004) Acte du Workshop MIXER,IUI-CADUI'04; Milgram, P., Kishino, A.F., A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality visual Displays IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems, E77-D (12), pp. 1321-1329; Azuma, R.T., A Survey of Augmented Reality (1997) Presence: Tele- Operators and Virtual Environments, 6 (4), pp. 355-385; Olsson, T., Ihamäki, P., Lagerstam, E., Ventä-Olkkonen, L., Väänänen-Vainio-Mattila, K., User expectations for mobile mixed reality services: An initial user study (2009) European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics, ECCE '09, p. 9. , Article 19; Azuma, R.T., A Survey of Augmented Reality (1997) Presence: Tele- Operators and Virtual Environments, 6 (4), pp. 355-385; Ware, C., Balakrishnan, R., Reaching for objects in VR displays: Lag and frame rate (1994) ACM Trans.

In particular, this problem is considered within a cellular network that employs terahertz (THz) operated RISs acting as base stations. To provide a seamless VR experience, high data rates and reliable low latency need to be continuously guaranteed. To address these challenges, a novel risk-based framework based on the entropic value-at-risk is proposed for rate optimization and reliability performance. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimization technique is used to reformulate the problem as a linear weighted function, while ensuring that higher order statistics of the queue length are maintained under a threshold. To address this problem, given the stochastic nature of the channel, a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed. Since the state space is extremely large, the policy is learned through a deep-RL algorithm. In particular, a recurrent neural network (RNN) RL framework is proposed to capture the dynamic channel behavior and improve the speed of conventional RL policy-search algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that the maximal queue length resulting from the proposed approach is only within 1% of the optimal solution. The results show a high accuracy and fast convergence for the RNN with a validation accuracy of 91.92%. © 2020 IEEE.",Reliability; Terahertz; Virtual Reality,Higher order statistics; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Value engineering; Virtual reality; Cellular network; Optimal solutions; Optimization techniques; Rate optimizations; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Reliability performance; Stochastic nature; Weighted function; Recurrent neural networks,"Chen, M., Saad, W., Yin, C., Virtual reality over wireless networks: Quality-of-service model and learning-based resource management (2018) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 66 (11), pp. 5621-5635. , Jun; Saad, W., Bennis, M., Chen, M., (2019) A Vision of 6G Wireless Systems: Applications, Trends, Technologies, and Open Research Problems; Gerardino, G., Alvarez, B., Pedersen, K., Mogensen, P., Mac layer enhancements for ultra-reliable low-latency communications in cellular networks Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 1-7. , Paris, France; Steeg, M., Stöhr, A., High data rate 6 gbit/s steerable multibeam 60 GHz antennas for 5g hot-spot use cases (2017) Proc. of IEEE Photonics Society Summer Topical Meeting Series (SUM), pp. 141-142. , San Juan, Puerto Rico, Jul; Moldovan, A., Karunakaran, P., Akyildiz, I.F., Gerstacker, W.H., Coverage and achievable rate analysis for indoor terahertz wireless networks (2017) Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 1-7. , Paris, France, Jul; Basar, E., Di Renzo, M., De Rosny, J., Debbah, M., Alouini, M.-S., Zhang, R., (2019) Wireless Communications Through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces; Kasgari, A.T.Z., Saad, W., Debbah, M., Human-in-the-loop wireless communications: Machine learning and brain-aware resource management (2019) IEEE Transactions on Communications, , to appear; Chen, M., Saad, W., Yin, C., Echo-liquid state deep learning for 360 content transmission and caching in wireless vr networks with cellularconnected uavs (2019) IEEE Transactions on Communications, 67 (9), pp. 6386-6400; Park, J., Bennis, M., Urllc-embb slicing to support vr multimodal perceptions over wireless cellular systems (2018) Proc. of IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), , Abu Dhabi, UAE, Dec; Cacciapuoti, A.S., Subramanian, R., Chowdhury, K.R., Caleffi, M., (2017) Software-defined Network Controlled Switching between Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Small Cells; Huang, C., Zappone, A., Alexandropoulos, G.C., Debbah, M., Yuen, C., Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for energy efficiency in wireless communication (2019) IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 18 (8), pp. 4157-4170; Jung, M., Saad, W., Jang, Y., Kong, G., Choi, S., Uplink data rate in large intelligent surfaces: Asymptotic analysis under channel estimation errors (2019) Submitted to Proc. of IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), , Marrakech, Morocco; Ahmadi-Javid, A., Entropic value-at-risk: A new coherent risk measure (2012) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 155 (3), pp. 1105-1123; Chaccour, C., Amer, R., Zhou, B., Saad, W., On the reliability of wireless virtual reality at terahertz (thz) frequencies (2019) Proc. of the 10th IFIP International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), , Canary Islands, Spain, June; Zhang, R., Yang, K., Abbasi, Q.H., Qaraqe, K.A., Alomainy, A., Analytical modelling of the effect of noise on the terahertz in-vivo communication channel for body-centric nano-networks (2018) Nano Communication Networks, 15, pp. 59-68; Neely, M.J., Stochastic network optimization with application to communication and queueing systems (2010) Synthesis Lectures on Communication Networks, 3 (1), pp. 1-211; Chen, M., Challita, U., Saad, W., Yin, C., Debbah, M., Artificial neural networks-based machine learning for wireless networks: A tutorial (2019) IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials; Sutton, R.S., Barto, A.G., (2018) Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, , MIT press; Naderi Soorki, M., Saad, W., Bennis, M., Ultra-reliable millimeterwave communications using an artificial intelligence-powered reflector (2019) Proc.

However, the direction and reliability of this effect is unclear as different studies have reported seemingly contradictory results. We have operationalized social perception as the ratings of strangeness for different avatars in a virtual reality study. The use of avatars ensured maximal control over the interlocutor's behaviour and a clear dimension along which to manipulate social perceptions toward this interlocutor. Our results suggest an inverted U-shaped curve in structural priming magnitude for passives as a function of strangeness: the participants showed the largest priming effects for the intermediately strange, with a decrease when interacting with the least-or most-strange avatars. The relationship between social perception and priming magnitude may thus be non-linear. There seems to be a 'happy medium' in strangeness, evoking the largest priming effect. We did not find a significant interaction of priming magnitude with any social perception. © 2017 Heyselaar et al.

Furthermore, the emergence of the sixth generation (6G) networks is profiling the ever more challenging applications' requirements imposed by the new era service classes. In order to guarantee efficient implementation and availability to the upcoming applications, characterized by stringent quality of experience requirements, an accurate network design and delay analysis is becoming mandatory to pursue efficient 6G network dimensioning and enable computing in the network-based applications. Toward this goal, this article proposes a suitable end-to-end delay performance analysis and reliability evaluation in the case of a 6G network offering virtual reality services, which is considered one of the most challenging technologies for the coming new era service classes. More in depth, the aim of the article is the formulation of the stochastic end-to-end delay bound by applying supermartingale envelopes in order to allow accurate VR reliability prediction in relation to the number of users linked to the same computing node with a specified service profile. The goodness and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by providing comparison with simulation results and analytical predictions derived by resorting to the use of the classical Markov queueing theory. © 1986-2012 IEEE.",,Computation theory; Distributed computer systems; Quality control; Quality of service; Queueing networks; Reliability analysis; Reliability theory; Stochastic systems; Virtual reality; Application requirements; Computing technology; Distributed mode; Edge-based; Efficient implementation; Network-delay; Networking technology; Service class; Stringents; Tera Hertz; Queueing theory,"Saad, W., Bennis, M., Chen, M., A Vision of 6G Wireless Systems: Applications, Trends, Technologies, and Open Research Problems (2020) IEEE Network, 34 (3), pp. 134-142. , May/June; Chaccour, C., (2020) Can Terahertz Provide High-Rate Reliable Low Latency Communications for Wireless VR?, , Apr; Sa De, A.Gomes, Zachmann, G., Virtual Reality as a Tool for Verification of Assembly and Maintenance Processes (1999) Computers and Graphics, 23 (3), pp. 389-403. , https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849399000473; Liu, Y., MEC-Assisted Panoramic VR Video Streaming over Millimeter Wave Mobile Networks (2019) IEEE Trans.

We proposed a system based on a virtual reality (HTC Vive) system with a tracker at the lumbar area. The position data of the tracker were obtained through detection of the sensors on the tracker by the VR system. The reliability and validity of these sway parameters to measure postural stability were evaluated. Twenty healthy adults had their postural sway measured with this system and a force platform system under four stance conditions, with wide-or narrow-stance and eyes open or closed. The path data from both systems were computed to obtain the following parameters: The mean distance and the mean velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and the 95% confidence ellipse area. The reliability of the Vive-based sway measures was tested with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The convergent validity was tested against the center of pressure (COP) parameters from the force platform system. Finally, the discriminative validity was tested for the above four conditions. The results indicated that the Vive-based sway parameters had moderate to high reliability (ICCs: 0.56 0.90) across four conditions and correlated moderately to very highly with the COP parameters ( {r} = 0.420\sim 0.959 ). Bland-Altman plotting showed generally good agreement, with negative offset for the Vive-based sway parameters. The sway parameters obtained by the Vive-based system also discriminated well among the tasks. In conclusion, the results support this system as a simple and easy-To-use tool to evaluate postural stability with acceptable reliability and validity. © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Biomechanics; instruments; measurement; virtual reality,Reliability; Virtual reality; Anterior posteriors; Center of pressure; Convergent validity; High reliability; Intraclass correlation coefficients; Neurorehabilitation; Postural stability; Reliability and validity; System stability; adult; Article; Berg Balance Scale; biomechanics; controlled study; convergent validity; correlation coefficient; discriminant validity; eye tracking; female; gait; human; human experiment; internal consistency; interrater reliability; joint function; locomotion; male; measurement accuracy; neurorehabilitation; parasympathetic tone; reliability; standing; test retest reliability; traffic accident; virtual reality; walking; body equilibrium; reproducibility; Adult; Humans; Postural Balance; Reproducibility of Results; Virtual Reality,"Pollock, A.S., Durward, B.R., Rowe, P.J., Paul, J.P., What is balance?

Items were generated based on literature and in a focus group pilot study (n = 20). Using factor analysis with maximum likelihood extraction and direct oblimin rotation, the initial scale was created after administration of these items (n = 314) and further refined after a second survey (n = 473). In the final solution, a total of 22 items clustered into a three-factor solution with the factors being “ease of use” (alpha =.858), “usefulness” (alpha =.857), and “enjoyment” (alpha =.919) and overall reliability of.910. Construct validity was established by correlating the AVRTS with the Technology Readiness Index and an access barrier scale, and internal validity was established by correlating the scale with its sub-scales. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Attitudes; Attitudes toward Virtual Reality Technology Scale (AVRTS); Enjoyment; Scale development; Technology Acceptance Model (TAM); Virtual reality,Maximum likelihood estimation; Virtual addresses; Attitudes; Enjoyment; Scale development; Technology acceptance model; Virtual reality technology; Virtual reality,"Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., Attitude-behavior relations: A theoretical analysis and review of empirical research (1977) Psychol Bull, 84, pp. 888-918. , 10.1037/0033-2909.84.5.888 DOI; Biocca, F., Delaney, B., Immersive virtual reality technology (1995) Communication in the age of virtual reality, pp. 57-124. , Biocca F, Levy MR, (eds), Erlbaum, Hillsdale; Bowman, N.D., Oliver, M.B., Rogers, R., Sherrick, B., Woolley, J., Chung, M.Y., In control or in their shoes?

This limits standardization, threatens reliability, and prevents the assessment of core visual functions such as visual processing speed. Increasingly available virtual reality devices allow to address these problems. One such device is the portable, light-weight, and easy-to-use Oculus Rift. It is head-mounted and covers the entire visual field, thereby shielding and standardizing the visual stimulation. A fundamental prerequisite to use Oculus Rift for neuropsychological assessment is sufficient test-retest reliability. Here, we compare the test-retest reliabilities of Bundesen's visual processing components (visual processing speed, threshold of conscious perception, capacity of visual working memory) as measured with Oculus Rift and a standard CRT computer screen. Our results show that Oculus Rift allows to measure the processing components as reliably as the standard CRT. This means that Oculus Rift is applicable for standardized and reliable assessment and diagnosis of elementary cognitive functions in laboratory and clinical settings. Oculus Rift thus provides the opportunity to compare visual processing components between individuals and institutions and to establish statistical norm distributions. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"controlled study; diagnosis; eye; head; human; human experiment; test retest reliability; velocity; virtual reality; visual field; visual stimulation; working memory; adolescent; adult; attention; biological model; computer interface; consciousness; devices; female; male; man machine interaction; methodology; neuropsychological test; pattern recognition; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychological model; reaction time; reproducibility; short term memory; standards; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Consciousness; Female; Humans; Male; Man-Machine Systems; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Neurological; Models, Psychological; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality; Young Adult","Neumann, O., (1987) Perspective on Perception and Action, 469. , (eds.

However, it is challenging for doctors to precisely and efficiently perform the percutaneous tumor punctures under free-breathing conditions. This is because the traditional RFA is based on the 2D CT Image information, the missing spatial and dynamic information is dependent on surgeons’ experience. This paper presents a novel quantitative and intuitive surgical navigation modality for percutaneous respiratory tumor puncture via augmented virtual reality, which is to achieve the augmented visualization of the pre-operative virtual planning information precisely being overlaid on intra-operative surgical scenario. In the pre-operation stage, we first combine the signed distance field of feasible structures (like liver and tumor) where the puncture path can go through and unfeasible structures (like large vessels and ribs) where the needle is not allowed to go through to quantitatively generate the 3D feasible region for percutaneous puncture. Then we design three constraints according to the RFA specialists consensus to automatically determine the optimal puncture trajectory. In the intra-operative stage, we first propose a virtual-real alignment method to precisely superimpose the virtual information on surgical scenario. Then, a user-friendly collaborative holographic interface is designed for real-time 3D respiratory tumor puncture navigation, which can effectively assist surgeons fast and accurately locating the target step-by step. The validation of our system is performed on static abdominal phantom and in vivo beagle dogs with artificial lesion. Experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed planning strategy is better than the manual planning sketched by experienced doctors. Besides, the proposed holographic navigation modality can effectively reduce the needle adjustment for precise puncture as well. Our system shows its clinical feasibility to provide the quantitative planning of optimal needle path and intuitive in situ holographic navigation for percutaneous tumor ablation without surgeons’ experience-dependence and reduce the times of needle adjustment. The proposed augmented virtual reality navigation system can effectively improve the precision and reliability in percutaneous tumor ablation and has the potential to be used for other surgical navigation tasks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Augmented virtual reality; Collaborative holographic navigation; Optimal path planning; Respiratory tumor puncture,"Ablation; Computerized tomography; Holography; Navigation systems; Needles; Surgery; Virtual reality; Clinical feasibility; Dynamic information; Intuitive surgical; Planning strategies; Radiofrequency ablation; Signed distance fields; Surgical navigation; Virtual information; Tumors; accuracy; algorithm; Article; calibration; human; image processing; liver tumor; priority journal; puncture; radiofrequency ablation; tumor ablation; virtual reality; animal; computer assisted surgery; diagnostic imaging; dog; liver tumor; puncture; reproducibility; three-dimensional imaging; Animals; Augmented Reality; Dogs; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Liver Neoplasms; Punctures; Reproducibility of Results; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Virtual Reality","Avgousti, S., Christoforou, E.G., Panayides, A.S., Voskarides, S., Novales, C., Nouaille, L., Pattichis, C.S., Vieyres, P., Medical telerobotic systems: current status and future trends (2016) Biomed.

The system integrates an edge server that uses scalable 360° tiling to adaptively split the present 360° view of a VR user into a panoramic baseline content layer and a viewport-specific enhancement content layer. The user is then served the two content layers over complementary WiFi and VLC wireless links such that the delivered viewport quality is maximized for the given WiFi and VLC transmission resources. We formally characterize the actions of the server using rate-distortion optimization that we solve at low complexity. To account for the users' mobility as they explore different 360° viewpoints of the 6DOF remote scene content and maintain reliable high-quality VLC connectivity, we explore dynamic VLC transmitter steering and assignment in the system as graph bottleneck matching that aims to maximize the received VLC SNR across all users. We formulate an effective low-complexity solution to this discrete combinatorial optimization problem of high complexity. The paper also contributes a first actual 6DOF body and head movement VR navigation dataset that we collected and facilitate to assess the performance of our system via simulation experiments. These demonstrate enhanced VLC transmission performance and an up to 7 dB gain in viewport quality over a state-of-The-Art VLC cellular system (LiFi), and an up to 10 dB gain in viewport quality over a state-of-The-Art traditional wireless streaming method, for 12K-120fps 360° 6DOF VR content. Moreover, the synergistic WiFi-VLC dual connectivity of the proposed system augments its reliability over the reference method LiFi that comprises only VLC links. These outcomes motivate further exploration and prototype implementation of our system. © 2021 ACM.",6DOF virtual reality; scalable 360° video tiling; visible light communication; wifi-VLC dual connectivity wireless streaming,Audio systems; Combinatorial optimization; Complex networks; Electric distortion; Image coding; Signal distortion; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Combinatorial optimization problems; Prototype implementations; Rate-distortion optimization; Reference method; State of the art; Streaming systems; Transmission performance; Transmission resources; Virtual reality,"https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, Opentrack VR tracking; https://partner.steamgames.com/vrlicensing, SteamVR Tracking; Begole, B., (2016) Why the Internet Pipes Will Burst When Virtual Reality Takes off Forbes Magazine, 2016. , Feb; Boyce, J.M., Ye, Y., Chen, J., Ramasubramonian, A.K., Overview of SHVC: Scalable extensions of the high efficiency video coding standard (2015) IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 26 (1), pp. 20-34. , 2015; Boyd, S., Vandenberghe, L., (2004) Convex Optimization, , Cambridge University Press; Brennan, D.G., Linear diversity combining techniques (2003) Proc IEEE, 91 (2), pp. 331-356. , 2003; Chakareski, J., Vr/ar immersive communication: Caching, edge computing, and transmission trade-offs (2017) Proc.

This paper presents a new methodology to use Unreal Engine 4.22 as a tool for lighting applications, allowing correct reproduction of artificial light distribution in the game engine by identifying and properly setting a restricted set of parameters. A real office was carefully reproduced, in both the Unreal Engine and DIALux evo software, as comparative case study. Then, the luminance distribution is calculated with both programs on the same surfaces in the virtual environment and compared with the real one. The results suggest a good reliability of the Unreal Engine in reproducing the light distribution, underlining slight differences under certain conditions. In light of these findings, the proposed method seems to validate the use of Unreal Engine as a light design tool. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Building performance; DIALux evo; Immersive virtual reality; Innovative lighting design; Unreal game engine,Architectural design; Cell proliferation; Luminance; Virtual reality; Building performance; Calibration methodologies; DIALux evo; Game Engine; Immersive virtual reality; In-buildings; Innovative lighting design; Light distribution; Lighting designs; Unreal game engine; Light sources,"Ahir, K., Govani, K., Gajera, R., Shah, M., Application on virtual reality for enhanced education learning, military training and sports (2020) Augmented Human Res., 5; Duarte, E., Rebelo, F., Teles, J., Wogalter, M.S., Behavioral compliance for dynamic versus static signs in an immersive virtual environment (2014) Appl.

The virtual reality environment offers an initial insight into the future workplace. For better immersion in the environment. HTC Vive were selected. The ergonomic method selected for assessment is called RULA. Because of work in a virtual reality environment, it is necessary to measure in the real laboratory environment.

Indeed, these assessments require certain motor or cognitive functions that are generally affected after a stroke. We have therefore developed a protocol, combining a robotic device and a virtual reality display, that enables the assessment of position sense without requiring active movement in the evaluated arm, involving the opposite arm or relying on working memory. As a preliminary step of validation, elbow joint position sense of healthy young adults was quantified and test-retest reliability was studied. Results show that this protocol can quantify elbow position sense of healthy young adults (mean detection threshold: Around 7 degrees), with a fair to good test-retest reliability. © 2017 IEEE.",assessment; Proprioception; reliability; robotics; upper limb; virtual reality,Display devices; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Reliability; Robotics; Sensory perception; Virtual reality; Active movements; assessment; Cognitive functions; Detection threshold; Robotic devices; Test-retest reliability; Upper limbs; Virtual-reality display; Exoskeleton (Robotics),"Goble, D.J., Anguera, J.A., Plastic changes in hand proprioception following force-field motor learning (2010) J Neurophysiol, 104 (3), pp. 1213-1215. , Sep; Schmidt, R.A., Lee, T., Motor control and learning (1988) Human Kinetics; Carey, L.M., Matyas, T.A., Frequency of discriminative sensory loss in the hand after stroke in a rehabilitation setting (2011) J Rehabil Med, 43 (3), pp. 257-263. , Feb; Goble, D.J., Proprioceptive acuity assessment via joint position matching: From basic science to general practice (2010) Phys Ther, 90 (8), pp. 1176-1184. , Aug; Carey, L.M., Oke, L.E., Matyas, T.A., Impaired limb position sense after stroke: A quantitative test for clinical use (1996) Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 77 (12), pp. 1271-1278. , Dec; Venancio, J., Lopes, D., Lourenco, J., Ribeiro, F., Knee joint position sense of roller hockey players: A comparative study (2016) Sports Biomech, 15 (2), pp. 162-168. , Jun; Fournier Belley, A., Bouffard, J., Brochu, K., Mercier, C., Roy, J.S., Bouyer, L., Development and reliability of a measure evaluating dynamic proprioception during walking with a robotized ankle-foot orthosis, and its relation to dynamic postural control (2016) Gait Posture, 49, pp. 213-218. , Jul 15; Little, C.E., Emery, C., Black, A., Scott, S.H., Meeuwisse, W., Nettel-Aguirre, A., Benson, B., Dukelow, S., Test-retest reliability of KINARM robot sensorimotor and cognitive assessment: In pediatric ice hockey players (2015) J Neuroeng Rehabil, 12, p. 78",,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,"2017 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation, ICVR 2017",19 June 2017 through 22 June 2017,,129921.0,23319569,9781509030538.0,,,English,"Int.

Such benefits could be exploited to improve teaching of surgical hand preparation (SHP), a practice crucial in preventing post-surgical infection. This study hypothesises that the utilisation of VR technology to demonstrate SHP technique will produce superior skill acquisition and longer skill retention than the standard practice of video demonstration. 40 healthcare students unfamiliar with SHP were recruited from a tertiary university and randomised into two groups. The control group (n=21) viewed a video demonstration of SHP while the VR group (n=19) viewed a VR demonstration of the same technique. Participants were assessed immediately after demonstration (acquisition score), and again one week later (retention score), using a 20-point assessment scale. Scores were compared between the groups. Groups were equal in age, prior education, handedness and gender distribution. Neither skill acquisition (Control mean: 12.29, VR mean: 12.84; p = 0.57) nor retention (Control mean: 12.29, VR mean: 12.74; p = 0.52) differed significantly between groups however a non-significant trend toward better performance in the VR group was observed. Parallel scoring of 35% of participants showed very high inter-rater reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.92). Utilisation of VR technology did not demonstrate a perceivable acquisition or retention benefit in the teaching of SHP. Future studies could investigate the value of more immersive features including 360-degree point of view or haptic feedback which were not features of the technology used in the present study. © 2017 IEEE.",Surgical Hand Preparation; Training; Virtual Reality,Demonstrations; E-learning; Education; Mergers and acquisitions; Personnel training; Surgery; Virtual reality; Correlation coefficient; Educational benefits; Gender distribution; Inter-rater reliabilities; Skill acquisition; Standard practices; Surgical Hand Preparation; Video demonstration; Serious games,"Herwaldt Loreen, A., Cullen Joseph, J., Scholz, D., French, P., Zimmerman, M.B., Pfaller Michael, A., A prospective study of outcomes healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with postoperative nosocomial infections (2006) Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol., 27 (12), pp. 1291-1298; Andersson, A.E., Bergh, J., Karlsson, J., Nilsson, K., Incitament n Institutionen for vardochn et al.

However, most of these investigations present applications that improve the management of the project in a single phase or aspect, leaving aside the generation of value throughout the entire project. This article presents a brief review of the current state of VR / AR technologies, proposes the application of the Lean philosophy trough VR / AR applications in the different phases of the life cycle of a building project, and also shows several applications in real cases in which encouraging intial results were obtained. The proposed applications proved to be efficient to improve the communication between the different stakeholders, improving the understanding of the project, giving reliability to the decision making process, foreseeing errors, decreasing negative iterations and avoiding the time delays generated by the lack of an adequate visualization of the project. Finally, some recommendations about the nomenclature and standarization of the development level of the VR/AR applications are provided. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

However, the reliability and validity in healthy populations need further exploration. The present study investigates the relationship between task indicators and brain structures in a healthy population using a VR-based navigation task, particularly the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus. Methods: Sixty healthy adults were randomly recruited to perform a VR-based path integration task, the digit span task (DST), and an MRI scan. The indicators of the VR-based path integration task were calculated, including the absolute distance error (ADE), degree of angle deviation (DAD), degree of path deviation (DPD), and return time (Time). The reliability of the above indicators was then estimated using the split-half method and Cronbach’s alpha. Correlation and regression analyses were then performed to examine the associations between these indicators and age, general cognitive ability (DST), and brain structural measures. Results: ADE, DAD, and DPD showed reasonable split-half reliability estimates (0.84, 0.81, and 0.72) and nice Cronbach’s alpha estimates (0.90, 0.86, and 0.96). All indicators correlated with age and DST. ADE and DAD were sensitive predictors of hippocampal volume, and return time was a predictor of EC thickness. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the VR-based path integration task exhibits good reliability and validity in the healthy population. The task indicators are age-sensitive, can capture working memory capacity, and are closely related to the integrity of individual EC and hippocampal structures. © 2022 by the authors.",entorhinal; hippocampus; reliability; virtual reality,adult; age; article; cognition; construct validity; controlled study; correlation analysis; Cronbach alpha coefficient; entorhinal cortex; female; hippocampus; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; randomized controlled trial; reliability; thickness; virtual reality; working memory,"(2002) World Population Ageing, 1950–2050, , United Nations, New York, NY, USA; Rudnicka, E., Napierala, P., Podfigurna, A., Meczekalski, B., Smolarczyk, R., Grymowicz, M., The World Health Organization (WHO) approach to healthy ageing (2020) Maturitas, 139, pp. 6-11. , 32747042; Loewenstein, D.A., Curiel, R.E., Duara, R., Buschke, H., Novel Cognitive Paradigms for the Detection of Memory Impairment in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease (2018) Assessment, 25, pp. 348-359. , 29214859; Jagust, W., Gitcho, A., Sun, F., Kuczynski, B., Mungas, D., Haan, M., Brain imaging evidence of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in normal aging (2006) Ann.

Then, a neural network model of the cabin was built. Through road tests, the excitation signal at the cabin suspension point and the response signal of interior vibration noise were measured under the idle condition and constant speed condition. The measured excitation signal was applied to the prediction model for frequency response analysis, in order to compute the interior noise within the range 20–200 Hz. The obtained simulation result of the vibration noise was compared with the experimental result and analyzed. As indicated from the analysis, the influence of excitation spectrum and the model can be reflected by the simulation response spectrum, which is consistent with the experimental result. The higher precision can be also obtained when the model is applied to predict the interior noise. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Frequency response analysis; Neural network; Vehicle cabin; Virtual reality,Acoustic noise measurement; Commercial vehicles; Finite element method; Frequency response; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Neural networks; Vehicles; Vibrations (mechanical); Virtual reality; Computational model; Excitation signals; Excitation spectrum; Frequency response analysis; Neural network model; Simulation response; Vehicle cabin; Vibration characteristics; Vibration analysis,"Andrzej, P., Tage, B., An investigation of the coupling between the passenger compartment and the truck in a sedan (2007) SAE, 2007, pp. 2356-2362; Norimasa, K., Masami, H., Hiroo, Y., Development for dynamic response analysis of acoustic trim (2009) SAE, 2009, pp. 1487-1493; Liu, Y., Yu, F., Liu, J., Modal analysis of vehicle compartment with acoustic-structure coupling (2005) Noise Vib Control, 5, pp. 38-40; Laurent, G., Morad, K., Energy, D., Field approach for low and medium frequency vibration acoustic analysis of a car body using a probabilistic computational model (2009) SAE, 2009, pp. 849-863; Kruntcheva, M.R., Acoustic-structural coupling of the automobile passenger compartment.

With this in mind, immersive virtual reality (VR) games are being developed to promote physical activity, and are generally evaluated through user studies. However, building such applications is time consuming and expensive. This paper introduces VR-Rides, an object-oriented application framework focused on the development of experiment-oriented VR exergames. Following the modular programming pattern, this framework facilitates the integration of different hardware (such as VR devices, sensors, and physical activity devices) within immersive VR experiences that overlay game narratives on Google Street View panoramas. Combining software engineering and interaction patterns, modules of VR-Rides can be easily added and managed in the Unity game engine. We evaluate the code efficiency and development effort across our VR exergames developed using VR-Rides. The reliability, maintainability, and usability of our framework are also demonstrated via code metrics analysis and user studies. The results show that investing in a systematic approach to reusing code and design can be a worthwhile effort for researchers beyond software engineering. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",code reuse; exergame; immersive virtual reality; object-oriented application framework; reusable component; Unity,Computer software reusability; Reliability analysis; Virtual reality; Code reuse; exergame; Immersive virtual reality; Object oriented application; Reusable components; Unity; Object oriented programming,"Staiano, A.E., Calvert, S.L., Exergames for physical education courses: physical, social, and cognitive benefits (2011) Child Dev Perspect, 5 (2), pp. 93-98; Kavanagh, S., Luxton-Reilly, A., Wuensche, B., Plimmer, B., A systematic review of virtual reality in education (2017) Themes Sci Technol Educ, 10 (2), pp. 85-119; Molina, K.I., Ricci, N.A., Moraes, S.A., Perracini, M.R., Virtual reality using games for improving physical functioning in older adults: a systematic review (2014) J Neuroeng Rehabil, 11 (1), p. 156; Ijaz, K., Ahmadpour, N., Naismith, S.L., Calvo, R.A., An immersive virtual reality platform for assessing spatial navigation memory in predementia screening: feasibility and usability study (2019) JMIR Mental Health, 6 (9); Trombetta, M., Paula, P., Henrique, B., Motion rehab AVE 3D: a VR-based exergame for post-stroke rehabilitation (2017) Comput Methods Programs Biomed, 151, pp. 15-20; Menin, A., Torchelsen, R., Nedel, L., An analysis of VR technology used in immersive simulations with a serious game perspective (2018) IEEE Comput Graph Appl, 38 (2), pp. 57-73; Gugenheimer, J., Stemasov, E., Frommel, J., Rukzio, E., (2017), ShareVR enabling co-located experiences for virtual reality between HMD and non-HMD users.

Good maintainability design can save substantial costs and reduce incidents and accidents throughout the product life cycle. Therefore, maintainability should be given full consideration in the early design stages. However, the current desktop tools are not effective to aid in maintainability design. Virtual reality (VR), a state-of-the-art of computer science, generates a virtual environment in which the user can have intuitive feelings and interact with virtual objects. In this paper, an immersive maintainability verification and evaluation system (IMVES) based on virtual reality is proposed. The goal of the system is to develop a cost-effective, rapid and precise method to improve the maintainability design in the early design stages. IMVES enables the user to interact with maintenance objects and conduct immersive simulations. Based on the developed methods, the data generated during simulation can be gathered to analyze the maintainability status. A case study applying IMVES into an aero-engine project is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system. Compared with desktop-based methods, the IMVES could provide a more efficient way to conduct a maintenance simulation. Furthermore, the credibility and objectivity of the maintainability evaluation are also improved. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Maintainability; Product Design; Virtual reality,Aircraft engines; Cost effectiveness; Life cycle; Maintainability; Virtual reality; Complex products; Cost effective; Early design stages; Evaluation systems; Maintenance simulation; Product life cycles; State of the art; Virtual objects; Product design,"Hobday, M., Rush, H., Tidd, J., Innovation in complex products and system (2004) Res.

However, it is typically measured via a mono-method, self-report approach. The current study introduces a virtual reality (VR) protocol to create an observational measure of adolescents’ responses to peer pressure to engage in antisocial activities. Data on the reliability and validity of the assessment procedure are presented. Participants (N = 264, 46% male, Mage = 18.17 years, 81% White) provided self-reports of susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure, antisocial behavior, dating violence perpetration, and depressive symptoms. Participants also engaged in 9 VR simulations, 4 of which involved antisocial peer pressure. Participant behavior in the VR simulations was coded for resistance to antisocial peer pressure. Approximately half the sample repeated the VR simulations at a 2-month follow-up. Resistance to antisocial peer pressure in 4 VR simulations evidenced item/simulation-level convergent validity with one another and discriminant validity against scores in 5 VR bystander behavior simulations. When scores from the 4 antisocial peer pressure VR simulations were summed into a total scale score, they demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, 2-month test–retest correlations, convergent validity with self-reports of susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure, and criterion validity with self-reports of antisocial behavior and dating violence perpetration. Associations with antisocial behavior and dating violence perpetration held after accounting for self-reports of susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure and participant gender. Results provide evidence that VR simulations may offer a psychometrically sound addition to self-report measures as a method for assessing responses to antisocial peer pressure. ©, Copyright © Society of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology.",,adolescent; adolescent behavior; antisocial personality disorder; female; human; male; peer pressure; procedures; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; virtual reality; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Female; Humans; Male; Peer Influence; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Virtual Reality,"Abbey, A., Parkhill, M.R., BeShears, R., Clinton-Sherrod, A.M., Zawacki, T., Cross-sectional predictors of sexual assault perpetration in a community sample of single African American and Caucasian men (2006) Aggressive Behaviors, 32, pp. 54-67; Albert, D., Steinberg, L., Judgment and decision making in adolescence (2011) Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21, pp. 211-224; Allen, J.P., Porter, M.R., McFarland, F.C., Leaders and followers in adolescent close friendships: Susceptibility to peer influence as a predictor of risky behavior, friendship instability, and depression (2006) Development and Psychopathology, 18, pp. 155-172; Bámaca, M.Y., Umaña-Taylor, A.J., Testing a model of resistance to peer pressure among Mexican-origin adolescents (2006) Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 35, pp. 626-640; Berndt, T.J., Developmental changes in conformity to peers and parents (1979) Developmental Psychology, 15, pp. 608-616; Beyers, J.M., Loeber, R., Untangling developmental relations between depressed mood and delinquency in male adolescents (2003) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 31, pp. 247-266; Bombari, D., Mast, M.S., Canadas, E., Bachmann, M., Studying social interactions through immersive virtual environment technology: Virtues, pitfalls, and future challenges (2015) Frontiers in Psychology, 6 (869), pp. 1-11; Borsari, B., Carey, K.B., Peer influences on college drinking: A review of the research (2001) Journal of Substance Abuse, 13, pp. 391-424; Calvete, E., Cardeñoso, O., Gender differences in cognitive vulnerability to depression and behavior problems in adolescents (2005) Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, 33, pp. 179-192; Campbell, D.T., Fiske, D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix (1959) Psychological Bulletin, 56, pp. 81-105; Capaldi, D.M., Dishion, T.J., Stoolmiller, M., Yoerger, K., Aggression toward female partners by at-risk young men: The contribution of male adolescent friendships (2001) Developmental Psychology, 37, pp. 61-73; Chmielewski, M., Watson, D., What is being assessed and why it matters: The impact of transient error on trait research (2009) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 97, pp. 186-202; Clark, L.A., Watson, D., Constructing validity: Basic issues in objective scale development (1995) Psychological Assessment, 7, pp. 309-319; DeKeseredy, W.S., Schwartz, M.D., (2013) Male peer support and violence against women: The history and verification of a theory, , Northeastern University Press, &, (Eds.).

The aim of this study was to develop an objective scale specific for the assessment of technical skills for LH (H-OSATS) and to demonstrate feasibility of use and validity in a virtual reality setting. Material and methods The scale was developed using a hierarchical task analysis and a panel of international experts. A Delphi method obtained consensus among experts on relevant steps that should be included into the H-OSATS scale for assessment of operative performances. Feasibility of use and validity of the scale were evaluated by reviewing video recordings of LH performed on a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator. Three groups of operators of different levels of experience were assessed in a Marseille teaching hospital (10 novices, 8 intermediates and 8 experienced surgeons). Correlations with scores obtained using a recognised generic global rating tool (OSATS) were calculated. Results A total of 76 discrete steps were identified by the hierarchical task analysis. 14 experts completed the two rounds of the Delphi questionnaire. 64 steps reached consensus and were integrated in the scale. During the validation process, median time to rate each video recording was 25 minutes. There was a significant difference between the novice, intermediate and experienced group for total H-OSATS scores (133, 155.9 and 178.25 respectively; p = 0.002). H-OSATS scale demonstrated high inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.930; p<0.001) and test retest reliability (ICC = 0.877; p<0.001). High correlations were found between total H-OSATS scores and OSATS scores (rho = 0.928; p<0.001). Conclusion The H-OSATS scale displayed evidence of validity for assessment of technical performances for LH performed on a virtual reality simulator. The implementation of this scale is expected to facilitate deliberate practice. Next steps should focus on evaluating the validity of the scale in the operating room. © 2018 Knight et al.

We begin this short paper with an overview of current diagnostic needs in the field of neuropsychology, and a vision of the advantages that immersive virtual reality has the potential to offer as a diagnostic platform. We then briefly summarize our preliminary efforts to develop a robust virtual reality platform for neuropsychological assessment that incorporates a variety of physiological metrics as well as detailed measures of multiple attributes of task performance in a Virtual Environments Grocery Store (VEGS). © 2013 IEEE.",Cognitive assessment; Neuropsychology; Rehabilitation; Virtual reality,Ability testing; Patient rehabilitation; Psychophysiology; Cognitive assessments; Current diagnostics; Executive function; Immersive virtual reality; Multiple attributes; Neuropsychological assessment; Neuropsychology; Selective attention; Virtual reality,"Caramazza, A., Hillis, A., For a theory of remediation of cognitive deficits (1993) Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 3 (3), pp. 217-234; Razani, J., Casas, R., Wong, J.T., Lu, P., Alessi, C., Josephson, K., Relationship between executive functioning and activities of daily living in patients with relatively mild dementia (2007) Applied Neuropsychology, 14, pp. 208-214; Wilson, B.A., Herbert, C.M., Shiel, A., (2003) Behavioural Approaches in Neuropsychological Rehabilitation: Optimising Rehabilitation Procedures, , Hove, UK: Psychology Press; Wilson, B.A., Cognitive rehabilitation: How it is and how it should be (1998) Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 3, pp. 487-496; Parsons, T.D., (2011) Neuropsychological Assessment Using Virtual Environments: Enhanced Assessment Technology for Improved Ecological Validity, pp. 271-289. , S.

While the technological development steadily pushes towards even more realistic renderings of the real world— the elusiveness of social and emotional elements gradually becomes more evident. This is not the least true for behavioral studies in rich sociocultural contexts. This article examines the outcomes of a study on distractions, taking place in a socially rich context—the classroom. The study made use of a Vir tual Reality environment simulating a junior high school lesson, where the Distraction condition consisted of peers watching nonrelevant content on their laptops. In the control condition these laptops were closed. No significant distraction effects were found, neither on learning nor behavior. Given the strong suppor t in the literature for such effects, the study design, including technical aspects, is scrutinized and discussed. We specifically highlight the difficulty of simulating a social relationship between the par ticipant and agents in VR, which in this case makes the distraction stimulus significantly weaker. It is argued that the distraction effect of nearby peers’ laptop use relies (par tly) on shared attention with social agents with an established social relation and common interests. © 2021 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Laptop computers; Virtual reality; Behavioural studies; Condition; Controlled laboratories; Ecological validity; Real-world; Realistic rendering; Social components; Sociocultural context; Technological development; Virtual learning environments; Ecology,"Adams, R., Finn, P., Moes, E., Flannery, K., Rizzo, A.

This is especially true for autonomous cars. Tasks performed by the driver are taken over by the vehicle and must be performed with maximum reliability. Developing these systems is a difficult task, especially due to limited testing capabilities. Testing a vehicle in a closed environment is safe and controlled, but the variety of test scenarios is limited. By using mixed reality environments, one can create a diverse environment around a real test vehicle, with traffic, obstacles, and unexpected situations. The real movement of the test vehicle allows testing decision and motion planning level vehicular functions. Information from the virtual world can be considered as input to the vehicle sensor. Mixed reality or digital twin simulation environments can greatly assist the autonomous vehicle development process and also serve as a basis for validation procedures for such systems.

Participants navigate a virtual apartment, performing household chores given by a virtual character. EPELI aims to tap attention, executive function, and prospective memory. To ensure its applicability to further research and clinical work and to study its relationship to relevant background factors, we examined several key properties of EPELI in 77 typically developing 9–13-year-old children. These included EPELI’s internal consistency, age and gender differences, sensitivity to gaming experience, head-mounted display (HMD) type, and verbal recall ability, as well as its relationships with parent-rated everyday executive problems. Of the eight EPELI measures, the following six showed acceptable internal consistency: task and navigation efficacy, number of correctly performed tasks and overall actions, time monitoring, and controller movement. Some measures were associated with age, gender, or verbal encoding ability. Moreover, EPELI performance was associated with parent-rated everyday executive problems. There were no significant associations of gaming background, task familiarity, or HMD type with the EPELI measures. These results attest to the reliability and ecological validity of this new virtual reality tool for the assessment of attention, executive functions, and prospective memory in children. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,"Auguie, B., (2017) GridExtra: Miscellaneous functions for “grid” graphics., , https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gridExtra, Accessed 17 Jan 2022; Ballhausen, N., Hering, A., Rendell, P.G., Kliegel, M., Prospective memory across the lifespan (2019) Prospective memory, pp. 135-156. , Rummel J, McDaniel M, (eds), Routledge; Barnett, J.H., Heron, J., Ring, S.M., Golding, J., Goldman, D., Xu, K., Jones, P.B., Gender-specific effects of the catechol-o-methyltransferase val 108/158 met polymorphism on cognitive function in children (2007) American Journal of Psychiatry, 164 (1), pp. 142-149; Barnett, M.D., Childers, L.G., Parsons, T.D., A virtual kitchen protocol to measure everyday memory functioning for meal preparation (2021) Brain Sciences, 11 (5), p. 571; Bauer, R.M., Iverson, G.L., Cernich, A.N., Binder, L.M., Ruff, R.M., Naugle, R.I., Computerized neuropsychological assessment devices: Joint position paper of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology and the National Academy of Neuropsychology (2012) Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 27 (3), pp. 362-373; Bediou, B., Adams, D.M., Mayer, R.E., Tipton, E., Green, C.S., Bavelier, D., Meta-analysis of action video game impact on perceptual, attentional, and cognitive skills (2018) Psychological Bulletin, 144 (1), pp. 77-110; Best, J.R., Miller, P.H., A developmental perspective on executive function: Development of executive functions (2010) Child Development, 81 (6), pp. 1641-1660; Brenhouse, H.C., Andersen, S.L., Developmental trajectories during adolescence in males and females: A cross-species understanding of underlying brain changes (2011) Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 35 (8), pp. 1687-1703; Bronfenbrenner, U., Toward an experimental ecology of human development (1977) American Psychologist, 32 (7), pp. 513-531; Brunswik, E., Organismic achievement and environmental probability (1943) Psychological Review, 50 (3), pp. 255-272; Burgess, P.W., Alderman, N., Forbes, C., Costello, A., Coates, L.M.-A., Dawson, D.R., Anderson, N.D., Channon, S., The case for the development and use of “ecologically valid” measures of executive function in experimental and clinical neuropsychology (2006) Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 12 (2), pp. 194-209; Casey, B., Tottenham, N., Liston, C., Durston, S., Imaging the developing brain: What have we learned about cognitive development?

METHODS: A CT scan and stereophotography were performed. The 3D CT models were reconstructed by Materialise Mimics software, and the stereophotogrammetric facial surface was reconstructed by 3dMD patient software. All 3D CT models were exported as Stereo Lithography file format, and the 3dMD model was exported as Virtual Reality Modeling Language file format. Image registration and fusion were performed in Mimics software. Genetic algorithm was used for precise image fusion alignment with minimum error. The 3D CT models and the 3dMD stereophotogrammetric facial surface were finally merged into a single file and displayed using Deep Exploration software. Errors between the CT soft tissue model and 3dMD facial surface were also analyzed. RESULTS: Virtual model based on CT-3dMD image fusion clearly showed the photorealistic face and bone structures. Image registration errors in virtual face are mainly located in bilateral cheeks and eyeballs, and the errors are more than 1.5 mm. However, the image fusion of whole point cloud sets of CT and 3dMD is acceptable with a minimum error that is less than 1 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The ease of use and high reliability of CT-3dMD image fusion allows the 3D virtual head to be an accurate, realistic, and widespread tool, and has a great benefit to virtual face model.

The ReHabgame was developed based on two third-person video games that provide a feasible possibility of assessing postural control and functional reach tests. It accurately quantifies specific postural control mechanisms including timed standing balance, functional reach tests using real-time anatomical landmark orientation, joint velocity, and acceleration while end trajectories were calculated using an inverse kinematics algorithm. The game was designed to help patients with neurological impairment to be subjected to physiotherapy activity and practice postures of daily activities. The subjective experience of the ReHabgame was studied through the development of an Engagement Questionnaire (EQ) for qualitative, quantitative and Rasch model. The Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Random object (ROG) generator algorithms were used to adapt the physical and gameplay intensity in the ReHabgame based on the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) and Hierarchical Scoring System (HSS). Rasch analysis was conducted to assess the psychometric characteristics of the ReHabgame and to identify if these are any misfitting items in the game. Rasch rating scale model (RSM) was used to assess the engagement of players in the ReHabgame and evaluate the effectiveness and attractiveness of the game. The results showed that the scales assessing the rehabilitation process met Rasch expectations of reliability, and unidimensionality. Infit and outfit mean squares values are in the range of (0.68–1.52) for all considered 16 items. The Root Mean Square Residual (RMSR) and the person separation reliability were acceptable. The item/person map showed that the persons and items were clustered symmetrically. © 2018",Computer science; Rehabilitation,,"Ortiz-Catalan, M., Nijenhuis, S., Ambrosch, K., Bovend Eerdt, T., Koenig, S., Lange, B., Virtual reality (2014) Emerging Therapies in Neurorehabilitation, pp. 249-265. , http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Virtual%20Reality.pdf, Springer; Kan, P., Huq, R., Hoey, J., Goetschalckx, R., Mihailidis, A., The development of an adaptive upper-limb stroke rehabilitation robotic system (2011) J.

Virtual reality (VR) is currently gaining credibility in the same fields as hypnosis for medical applications. Lately, the combination of hypnosis and VR was con-sidered. The aim of this scoping review is to understand the current studied contexts and effects of virtual reality hypnosis (VRH) for the management of pain. We searched on PubMed, Taylor & Francis Online, and ProQuest databases with the following terms: “virtual reality,” “3D,” “hypnosis,” and “pain”. We included 8 studies that combined hypnosis and VR. All articles are in English. Two included healthy volunteers and six are clinical studies. Short-term results indicated significant decreases in pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, time spent thinking about pain, anxiety, and levels of opioids. However, results are not consistent for all patients all the days. VR alone seems to reduce pain independently of the hypnotiz-ability level. One study claimed that VR and hypnosis could alter each other’s effects and another argued that VR did not inhibit the hypnotic process and may even facilitate it by employing visual imagery. We cannot affirm that VR added value to hypnosis when they are combined. These trials and case series gave us indications about the possible applications of VRH in different contexts. Additional randomized clinical trials on VRH in the future will have to test this technique in clinical practice and help define guidelines for VRH utilization in pain management. © 2020 Rousseaux et al.",3D animation; Acute pain; Chronic pain; Hypnosis; Virtual reality; Virtual reality hypnosis,opiate; analgesia; anxiety disorder; chronic pain; health care utilization; human; hypnosis; outcome assessment; pain; pain assessment; pain intensity; Review; three-dimensional imaging; treatment indication; treatment outcome; treatment response; virtual reality; virtual reality hypnosis,"Morley, S., Williams, A., Eccleston, C., Examining the evidence about psychological treatments for chronic pain: Time for a paradigm shift?

Lighting systems play an important role in the evolution process, thanks to their ability to affect city life at night along with people s mood and behaviour. In this scenario, advanced lighting design methods such as virtual reality (VR) became essential to assess lighting systems from different points of view, especially those linked with the city users expectations. Initially, the review highlights a list of objective and subjective parameters to be considered for the lighting design of three main city areas/applications: roads, green areas and buildings. Besides, the state-of-Art in using VR for outdoor lighting design is established. Finally, the Unreal game engine is used to analyse the ability of VR to take into account the lighting parameters, not yet investigated in current literature and to highlight the VR potential for augmenting lighting design. The results confirm the benefit of using VR in lighting design, even if further investigations are needed to establish its reliability, especially from the photometrical point of view. © 2020 MDPI AG.

To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM) and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users' reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content transmission format for each cellular-connected UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields 25.4% gain in terms of reliability compared to Q-learning. © 2019 IEEE.",,Antennas; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Radio links; Reinforcement learning; Reliability; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle transmissions; Virtual reality; Backhaul traffics; Content caching; Content transmission; Echo state networks; Liquid state machines; Optimal content; Optimization problems; Transmission problem; Deep learning,"Bastug, E., Bennis, M., Medard, M., Debbah, M., Toward interconnected vutual reality: Opportunities, challenges, and enablers (2017) IEEE Communications Magazine, 55 (6), pp. 110-117. , June; Schaufler, G., Sttirzlinger, W., A three dimensional image cache for virtual reality (1996) Computer Graphics Forum, 15 (3), pp. 227-235. , Aug; Tran, T.X., Kazemi, F., Karimi, E., Pompili, D., Mobee: Mobilityaware energy-efficient coded caching in cloud radio access networks,"" to (2017) Proc. of IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS, , Orlando, FL, USA, Oct; Zhao, N., Cheng, F., Yu, F.R., Tang, J., Chen, Y., Gui, G., Sari, H., Caching uav assisted secure transmission in hyper-dense networks based on interference alignment (2018) IEEE TransactiOns on Communications, , to appear; Chen, M., Mozaffari, M., Saad, W., Yin, C., Debbah, M., Hong, C.S., Caching in the sky: Proactive deployment of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles for optimized quality-of-experience (2017) IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 35 (5), pp. 1046-1061. , May; Sun, Y., Cui, Y., Liu, H., Joint pushing and caching for bandwidth utilization maximization in wireless networks (2018) IEEE Transactions on Communications, , to appear; Yang, Z., Pan, C., Pan, Y., Wu, Y., Xu, W., Shikh-Bahaei, M., Chen, M., Cache placement in two-Tier hetnets with limited storage capacity: Cache or buffer?

Forty-two subjects (21 males) were recruited in this study. Subjects were asked to estimate the reachability distance to an approaching confederate in the real and virtual environments. Results showed that the reachability distance obtained in the virtual reality environment was significantly larger than that in the real world. A similar result was found in the two methods: subjects chose a significantly larger reachability distance when facing male confederate than female confederate. Besides, both virtual reality technology and manual measurement showed high reliability when measuring the reachability distance. Using virtual reality technology to collect reachability distance had higher reliability than using the manual method when facing male and female confederates. © 2020 IEEE.",comparative evaluation; manual measurement; reachability distance; virtual reality,Facings; High reliability; Manual measurements; Manual methods; Reachability; Real-world; Virtual reality simulations; Virtual reality technology; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual reality,"Berti, A., Frassinetti, F., When far becomes near: Remapping of space by tool use (2000) J.

Methods: In this pilot study, we prospectively recruited participants who had received HFA3 SITA standard 30-2 perimetry and tested them with LUXIE on the same day. LUXIE is a software designed for visual field testing cooperating with HTC Vive Pro Eye, a head-mounted virtual reality device with an eye-tracking system. The test stimuli were synchronized with eye movements captured by the eye-tracking system to eliminate fixation loss. The global, hemifields, quadrants, glaucoma hemifield test (GHT) sectors, and point-by-point retinal sensitivities were compared between LUXIE and HFA3. All participants were asked to fill out a post-test user survey. Results: Thirty-eight participants with 65 eyes were enrolled. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3 in global (r = 0.81), superior hemifield (r = 0.77), superonasal, superotemporal, and inferonasal quadrants (r = 0.80, 0.78, 0.80). The user survey showed that participants were more satisfied with LUXIE in operating difficulty, comfortability, time perception, concentration, and overall satisfaction. Conclusions: LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with HFA3. Fixation loss could be eliminated in LUXIE with the eye-tracking system. The application of virtual reality devices such as the HTC Vive Pro Eye makes telemedicine and even home-based self-screening visual field tests possible. Key Messages: 1. Virtual reality perimetry is a developing technology that has the potential in telemedicine, and home self-screening visual field tests. 2. LUXIE demonstrated good correlations with Humphrey Field Analyzer 3 in visual field retinal sensitivities. © 2022 by the authors.",head-mounted device; Humphrey; LUXIE; perimetry; virtual reality,adult; Article; controlled study; eye tracking; eyelid; female; glaucoma; human; human experiment; male; middle aged; perception; perimetry; pilot study; validation study; virtual reality; visual stimulation,"Bevers, C., Blanckaert, G., Van Keer, K., Fils, J.F., Vandewalle, E., Stalmans, I., Semi-automated kinetic perimetry: Comparison of the Octopus 900 and Humphrey visual field analyzer 3 versus Goldmann perimetry (2019) Acta Ophthalmol, 97, pp. e499-e505. , 30345638; Wu, Z., Medeiros, F.A., Recent developments in visual field testing for glaucoma (2018) Curr.

However reliability and usability of the test developed within virtual reality paradigm are often neglect. In this study we test both reliability and usability using well-known psychometrics methods for the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET). In a first experiment, for the reliability, two independent researchers scored the test through several videos. For the usability assessment we analyzed 21 healthy participants and 3 patients with Parkinson’s disease. © 2013 Interactive Media Institute.",Assessment; Executive functions; Multiple errand test; NeuroVR; Psychometric reliability; Psychometrics; Usability; Virtual reality; VMET,adult; aged; Article; human; major clinical study; neuropsychological test; Parkinson disease; productivity; psychometry; reliability; satisfaction; scientist; virtual multiple errands test; virtual reality,"Riva, G., Applications of virtual environments in medicine (2003) Methods Inf Med, 42 (5), pp. 524-534; Gaggioli, A., Keshner, E.A., Weiss, P.L., Riva, G., (2009) Advanced Technologies in Rehabilitation -Empowering Cognitive, Physical, Social and Communicative Skills through Virtual Reality, Robots, Wearable Systems and Brain-Computer Interfaces, , Amsterdam, IOS Press; Raspelli, S., Pallavicini, F., Carelli, L., Morganti, F., Pedroli, E., Cipresso, P., Poletti, B., Riva, G., Validating the Neuro VR-based virtual version of the Multiple Errands Test: Preliminary results (2012) Presence-Teleoperators And Virtual Environments, 21, pp. 31-42; Cipresso, P., Gaggioli, A., Serino, S., Pallavicini, F., Raspelli, S., Grassi, A., Riva, G., EEG alpha asymmetry in virtual environments for the assessment of stress-related disorders (2012) Studies In Health Technology And Informatics, 173, pp. 102-104; Villani, D., Repetto, C., Cipresso, P., Riva, G., May I experience more presence in doing the same thing in virtual reality than in reality?

Citizens’ involvement can positively contribute to foster resilience for mitigating the impact of climate change. Successful integration of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) into the urban fabric enables both the mitigation of climate hazards and positive reactions of citizens. This paper presents two case studies in a southern district of Milan (Italy), investigating the emotional reaction of citizens to existing urban greenery and designed NBS. During the events, the participants explored in Virtual Reality (VR) (n = 48) and Augmented Reality (AR) (n = 63) (i) the district in its current condition and (ii) the design project of a future transformation including NBS. The environmental exploration and the data collection took place through the exp-EIA© method, integrated into the mobile app City Sense. The correlations between the color features of the viewed landscape and the emotional reaction of participants showed that weighted saturation of green and lime colors reduced the unpleasantness both in VR and AR, while the lime pixel area (%) reduced the unpleasantness only in VR. No effects were observed on the Arousal and Sleepiness factors. The effects show high reliability between VR and AR for some of the variables. Implications of the method and the benefits for urban simulation and participatory processes are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

For that reason, when facing the problem of Collision Detection for a Virtual Reality application, we firstly focus our attention on optimizing time performance for collisions among objects. Spatial Partitioning algorithms have been broadly used in Collision Detection. In particular, voxel-based methods are simple and quick, but finding the optimum voxel size is not trivial. We propose a methodology to easily determine the optimal voxel size for Collision Detection algorithms. Using an algorithm which represents volumetric objects with tetrahedra as an example, a performance cost function is defined in order to analytically bound the voxel size that gives the best computation times. This is made by inferring and estimating all the parameters involved. Thus, the cost function is delimited to depend only on geometric data. By doing so, it is possible to determine the optimal voxelization for any algorithm and scenario. Several solutions have been researched and compared.

This study proposes an affection-oriented model to understand the roles of young learners’ epistemic curiosity traits and triggered situational interest in their attitudinal learning from the affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions in IVR learning contexts. Through a series of PLS-SEM analyses with 90 elementary school students, the results of the measurement model test have verified the reliability and validity of the instruments employed in this study. The structural relationships among epistemic curiosity, situational interest, and attitudinal learning were also confirmed. The triggered situational interests of novelty and exploration intention during the IVR learning process were further identified as the mediators in the research model. While the students’ senses of novelty mediated the relationship between curiosity and cognitive attitudinal learning, their senses of interest in exploration intention mediated both the relationships between curiosity and affective attitudinal learning and between curiosity and behavioral attitudinal learning. This study contributed to establishing the theoretical framework for affection-oriented IVR learning. © The Author(s) 2022.",elementary education; evaluation methodologies; simulations; virtual reality,,"Araiza-Alba, P., Keane, T., Chen, W.S., Kaufman, J., Immersive virtual reality as a tool to learn problem-solving skills (2021) Computers & Education, 164 (2), p. 104121. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2020.104121; Berlyne, D.E., A theory of human curiosity (1954) British Journal of Psychology, 45 (3), pp. 180-191. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1954.tb01243.x; Bråten, I., Anmarkrud, I., Brandmo, C., Strømsø, H.I., Developing and testing a model of direct and indirect relationships between individual differences, processing, and multiple-text comprehension (2014) Learning and Instruction, 30, pp. 9-24. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2013.11.002; Bressler, D.M., Shane Tutwiler, M., Bodzin, A.M., Promoting student flow and interest in a science learning game: A design-based research study of school scene investigators (2021) Educational Technology Research and Development, 69 (5), pp. 2789-2811. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-021-10039-y; Chang, S.C., Hsu, T.C., Kuo, W.C., Jong, M.S.Y., Effects of applying a VR‐based two‐tier test strategy to promote elementary students’ learning performance in a Geology class (2019) British Journal of Educational Technology, 51 (1), pp. 148-165. , https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.12790; Checa, D., Bustillo, A., A review of immersive virtual reality serious games to enhance learning and training (2019) Multimedia Tools and Applications, 79 (4), pp. 1-27. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-019-08348-9; Chen, A., Darst, P.W., Pangrazi, R.P., What constitutes situational interest?

However, several studies suggest that VR induced adverse symptoms and effects (VRISE) may undermine the health and safety standards, and the reliability of the scientific results. In the current literature review, the technical reasons for the adverse symptomatology are investigated to provide suggestions and technological knowledge for the implementation of VR head-mounted display (HMD) systems in cognitive neuroscience. The technological systematic literature indicated features pertinent to display, sound, motion tracking, navigation, ergonomic interactions, user experience, and computer hardware that should be considered by the researchers. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of 44 neuroscientific or neuropsychological studies involving VR HMD systems was performed. The meta-analysis of the VR studies demonstrated that new generation HMDs induced significantly less VRISE and marginally fewer dropouts. Importantly, the commercial versions of the new generation HMDs with ergonomic interactions had zero incidents of adverse symptomatology and dropouts. HMDs equivalent to or greater than the commercial versions of contemporary HMDs accompanied with ergonomic interactions are suitable for implementation in cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, researchers' technological competency, along with meticulous methods and reports pertinent to software, hardware, and VRISE, are paramount to ensure the health and safety standards and the reliability of neuroscientific results. © Copyright © 2019 Kourtesis, Collina, Doumas and MacPherson.",cybersickness; HMD; neuropsychology; neuroscience; psychology; virtual reality; VR; VRISE,adverse outcome; biosafety; clinical effectiveness; cognition; ergonomics; health hazard; human; knowledge; medical device complication; medical technology; meta analysis; methodology; motion; neuronavigation; neuropsychology; neuroscience; personal experience; professional competence; reliability; Review; software; sound; symptomatology; systematic review; virtual reality; virtual reality induced adverse symptoms and effects,"Allen, C.L., Bayraktutan, U., Oxidative stress and its role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke (2009) Int.

VR game addiction (VAD) occurs simultaneously and brings about psychological issues. The current research employed a maximum likelihood estimation method to construct a structural equation model, by which learners' VR consumption behaviors were examined. The bootstrapping approach was adopted to explore further the mediation of VR realism (VRR) and the moderation of VR affordance on learners' VAD, which potentially leads to distressing behavioral and psychological circumstances. Data were collected from 575 students recruited in the survey, which was followed by a test of reliability and validity through confirmative factor analysis. Results concluded that VRR and consumers' cognitive satisfaction played a significant role as mediators while conceptualizing addictive behavior based on VR-perceived experience of consumers, self-efficacy, and interactivity. Moreover, this study conceptualized addictive behavior toward VR games through a structural equation model in a media-rich environment and suggested practical implications to reduce addictive behavior. © 2020 Xuesong Zhai et al.",,,"Ryan, R.M., Rigby, C.S., Przybylski, A., The motivational pull of video games: A self-determination theory approach (2006) Motivation and Emotion, 30, pp. 347-363. , 2-s2.0-33845628973; Behzadnia, B., Adachi, P.J.C., Deci, E.L., Mohammadzadeh, H., Associations between students' perceptions of physical education teachers' interpersonal styles and students' wellness, knowledge, performance, and intentions to persist at physical activity: A self-determination theory approach (2018) Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 39, pp. 10-19. , 2-s2.0-85049744390; Liu, Q.-Q., Zhang, D.-J., Yang, X.-J., Zhang, C.-Y., Fan, C.-Y., Zhou, Z.-K., Perceived stress and mobile phone addiction in Chinese adolescents: A moderated mediation model (2018) Computers in Human Behavior, 87, pp. 247-253. , 2-s2.0-85049320204; Balakrishnan, J., Griffiths, M.D., Loyalty towards online games, gaming addiction, and purchase intention towards online mobile in-game features (2018) Computers in Human Behavior, 87, pp. 238-246. , 2-s2.0-85049315745; Horwood, S., Anglim, J., Problematic smartphone usage and subjective and psychological well-being (2019) Computers in Human Behavior, 97, pp. 44-50. , 2-s2.0-85062392831; Błachnio, A., Przepiorka, A., Personality and positive orientation in Internet and Facebook addiction.

Recently, a multimodal and holistic framework was developed, the Game Transfer Phenomena (GTP) framework. It investigates the relation between in-game elements (e.g. structural characteristics, in-game phenomena) involved in everyday involuntary phenomena or intrusions with game contents, and the subsequent implications of these phenomena on gamers’ well-being. This paper aims to overview research on GTP for explaining the development of the framework and discuss its potential applications. The GTP framework was developed based on studies conducted with over 3,500 gamers collected via interviews, online forums and surveys. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the factorial structure and demonstrated good reliability and validity of the items in the scale used for assessing GTP. The GTP experiences were classified in three main modalities: (i) altered sensorial perceptions comprising perceptions and/or sensations in all sensorial channels, cross-sensory or multisensory. These were further subdivided into: altered visual perceptions (e.g. visual hallucinations), altered auditory perceptions (e.g. auditory imagery), and altered body/other perceptions (e.g. illusion of body motion). (ii) Automatic mental processes comprising thoughts, urges and automatic mental actions, and (iii) behaviors and actions comprising simple actions or more elaborate behaviors (e.g. verbal outburst). The GTP framework can assist in identifying an underlying mechanism of the virtual immersion either for reducing potential unwanted effects or for promoting desirable cognitions and behaviors with educative, therapeutic and entertainment means. © 2016 by Interactive Media Institute.",Effects of playing video games; Game transfer phenomena; Implicit cognitions; Non-volitional phenomena,adolescent; adult; Article; conceptual framework; confirmatory factor analysis; game transfer phenomena framework; hearing; human; immersion; interview; mental function; sensation; video game; virtual reality; vision; wellbeing,"Connolly, T.M., A systematic literature review of empirical evidence on computer games and serious games (2012) Computers & Education, 59, pp. 661-686; Brunborg, G.S., Mentzoni, R.A., Frøyland, L.R., Is video gaming, or video game addiction, associated with depression, academic achievement, heavy episodic drinking, or conduct problems?

In this regard, there are many important questions about which direction modern journalism should take as a whole. To test the feasibility of immersive storytelling, this study developed a cognitive experience model containing paths for presence, flow, credibility, empathy, understanding, and enjoyment. A total of 131 participants were divided into three groups and exposed to either VR, 360-degree videos, or two-dimensional (2D) videos, then asked to rate their experiences. With the exception of understanding, results showed that the VR and 360-degree videos were more highly evaluated in each path when compared with 2D videos. In this case, technical attributes did not greatly affect the study variables. However, presence played a vital role in news promotion, while flow was positively affected by presence; flow also affected other variables when combined with presence. Finally, a structural equation model was tested and the weights of the different influences on the enjoyment impact were presented. In sum, this study found that immersive storytelling improved both presence, flow, and credibility, which jointly and positively affected enjoyment. Understanding negatively affected enjoyment. Empathy had little effect on enjoyment in the model.

In this research, the authors examine the potential for using Google Cardboard VR in business classrooms as a content delivery platform. They specifically investigate how VR (viewing a 3-dimensional, 360° video) differs from the traditional flat-screen (FS) format (viewing a 2-dimensional video [e.g., iPod (Apple, Cupertino, CA)]) as a teaching tool to deliver video-based content. The results demonstrate that participants in the VR condition (vs. the FS condition) rated their enjoyment and interest to be higher. However, the Google Cardboard VR platform was not superior to the iPod FS format in its content delivery with respect to novelty, reliability, and understandability. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",360 videos; content delivery; Google Cardboard; virtual reality,,"Allison, D., Wills, B., Bowman, D., Wineman, J., Hodges, L.F., The virtual reality gorilla exhibit (1997) IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, 17 (6), pp. 30-38; Anderson, P.L., Zimand, E., Hodges, L.F., Rothbaum, B.O., Cognitive behavioral therapy for public speaking anxiety using virtual reality for exposure (2005) Depression and Anxiety, 22, pp. 156-158; Barab, S.A., Hay, K.E., Barnett, M., Keating, T., Virtual Solar System Project: Building Understanding through Model Building (2000) Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 37, pp. 719-756; Bellani, M., Fornasari, L., Chittaro, L., Brambilla, P., Virtual reality in autism: state of the art (2011) Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences, 20, pp. 235-238; Bolton, D., Why virtual reality education is the next frontier for classrooms (2016) Arc from Applause, , https://arc.applause.com/2016/06/30/virtual-reality-education/, June 30, Retrieved from; Bordnick, P.S., Carter, B.L., Traylor, A.C., What virtual reality research in addictions can tell us about the future of obesity assessment and treatment (2011) Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, 5, pp. 265-271; Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., Situated cognition and the culture of learning (1989) Educational Researcher, 18, pp. 32-43; Bruner, J.S., (1966) Toward a theory of instruction, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, (59); Burdea, G.C., Teaching virtual reality: Why and how?

OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using the virtual reality game 'Timocco' as an assessment tool for evaluating goal-directed hand movements among typically developing children. METHODS: In this pilot study, 47 typically-developing children were divided into two age groups, 4-6 years old and 6-8 years old. Performance was measured using two different virtual environment games (Bubble Bath and Falling Fruit), each with two levels of difficulty. Discriminative validity (age effect) was examined by comparing the performance of the two groups, and by comparing the performance between levels of the games for each group (level effect). Test-retest reliability was examined by reassessing the older children 3-7 days after the first session. RESULTS: He older children performed significantly better in terms of response time,action time, game duration, and efficiency in both games compared to the younger children. Both age groups demonstrated poorer performance at the higher game level in the Bubble Bath game compared to the lower level. A similar level effect was found in the Falling Fruit game for both age groups in response time and efficiency, but not in action time. The performance of the older children was not significantly different between the two sessions at both game levels. CONCLUSIONS: The discriminative validity and test-retest reliability indicate the feasibility of using the Timocco virtual reality game as a tool for assessing goal-directed hand movements in children. Further studies should examine its feasibility for use in children with disabilities. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

The objective was to compare student understanding in diagnosing and treatment planning complex orthognathic cases using the VR patient versus a conventional 2D prediction tracing method and to determine feasibility of utilizing VR methods. Thirty third year dental students were assigned randomly to an experimental (VR patient) or control (2D tracing) group. The dependent variables were a multiple choice question (MCQ) examination, baseline and exit surveys, and written case analysis of two cases. Student–teacher interactions were recorded for both length and type of interaction. Data were evaluated using descriptive and inferential statistics. The students’ performance on the MCQ examinations improved immediately following the educational intervention (p <.05). However, no significant difference was found between the 2 groups on the written case analysis and pre-test, post-test, and follow-up MCQ examinations. The effect size of the intervention ranged from.14 to.90 and differed greatly between the written responses to the two cases. Intra- and inter-rater reliability of the written response scoring was found to be reliable and reproducible (>.928). Dental students were able to improve their understanding of diagnosis and treatment planning of orthognathic cases using both 2D prediction tracing and the VR patient methods. The method of scoring the written responses was reliable and reproducible and should be used for future full-scale studies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Dental education;

Objective: The aim of this study was to obtain validity evidence for relationships to other variables, internal structure, and consequences of testing for the task scores of a new low-cost portable simulator mediated by gestures for learning basic psychomotor skills in minimally invasive surgery. This new simulator is called SIMISGEST-VR (Simulator of Minimally Invasive Surgery mediated by Gestures - Virtual Reality). Methods: In this prospective observational validity study, the authors looked for multiple sources of evidence (known group construct validity, prior videogaming experience, internal structure, test-retest reliability, and consequences of testing) for the proposed SIMISGEST-VR tasks. Undergraduate students (n=100, reference group), surgical residents (n=20), and experts in minimally invasive surgery (n=28) took part in the study. After answering a demographic questionnaire and watching a video of the tasks to be performed, they individually repeated each task 10 times with each hand. The simulator provided concurrent, immediate, and terminal feedback and obtained the task metrics (time and score). From the reference group, 29 undergraduate students were randomly selected to perform the tasks 6 months later in order to determine test-retest reliability. Results: Evidence from multiple sources, including strong intrarater reliability and internal consistency, considerable evidence for the hypothesized consequences of testing, and partial confirmation for relations to other variables, supports the validity of the scores and the metrics used to train and teach basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery via a new low-cost portable simulator that utilizes interaction technology mediated by gestures. Conclusions: The results obtained provided multiple sources of evidence to validate SIMISGEST-VR tasks aimed at training novices with no prior experience and enabling them to learn basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery. © JMIR Publications 2020.

We investigated the accuracy of simulated surgical planning in a VR environment (VR) with temporal bones and compared it to conventional cross-sectional image viewing in picture archiving and communication system (PACS) interface. Methods: Five experienced otologic surgeons measured significant anatomic structures and fiducials on five fresh-frozen cadaveric temporal bones in VR and cross-sectional viewing. Primary image data were acquired by computed tomography. In total, 275 anatomical landmark measurements and 250 measurements of the distance between fiducials were obtained with both methods. Distance measurements between the fiducials were confirmed by physical measurement obtained by Vernier caliper. The experts evaluated the subjective validity of both methods on a 5-point Likert scale qualitative survey. Results: A strong correlation based on intraclass coefficient was found between the methods on both the anatomical (r > 0.900) and fiducial measurements (r > 0.916). Two-tailed paired t-test and Bland–Altman plots demonstrated high equivalences between the VR and cross-sectional viewing with mean differences of 1.9% (p = 0.396) and 0.472 mm (p = 0.065) for anatomical and fiducial measurements, respectively. Gross measurement errors due to the misidentification of fiducials occurred more frequently in the cross-sectional viewing. The mean face and content validity rating for VR were significantly better compared to cross-sectional viewing (total mean score 4.11 vs 3.39, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study supports good accuracy and reliability of VR environment for simulated surgical planning in temporal bones compared to conventional cross-sectional visualization. © 2020, The Author(s).",Surgical planning; Temporal bone; Three-dimensional; Two-dimensional; Virtual reality,anatomic landmark; Article; computer assisted tomography; content validity; depth perception; ergonomics; eye tracking; feasibility study; human; Likert scale; neuroradiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preoperative care; questionnaire; radiation dose; reliability; signal noise ratio; simulation; surgical mortality; temporal bone; validation study; virtual reality; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; reproducibility; surgery; temporal bone; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Temporal Bone; Virtual Reality,"Kashikar, T.S., Kerwin, T.F., Moberly, A.C., Wiet, G.J., A review of simulation applications in temporal bone surgery (2019) Laryngoscope Investig Otolaryngol, 4 (4), pp. 420-424; Kraeima, J., Dorgelo, B., Gulbitti, H.A., Steenbakkers, R.J.H.M., Schepman, K.P., Roodenburg, J.L.N., Multi-modality 3D mandibular resection planning in head and neck cancer using CT and MRI data fusion: a clinical series (2018) Oral Oncol, 81, pp. 22-28. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC1MblsFaitw%3D%3D; Francis, H.W., Malik, M.U., Diaz Voss Varela, D.A., Barffour, M.A., Chien, W.W., Carey, J.P., Technical skills improve after practice on virtual-reality temporal bone simulator (2012) Laryngoscope., 122 (6), pp. 1385-1391; Lee, C., Wong, G.K.C., Virtual reality and augmented reality in the management of intracranial tumors: a review (2019) J Clin Neurosci, 62, pp. 14-20; Chinnock, C., Virtual reality in surgery and medicine (1994) Hosp Technol, 13 (18), p. 1. , COI: 1:STN:280:DyaK2M7jtVOnsw%3D%3D; Triepels, C.P.R., Smeets, C.F.A., Notten, K.J.B., Kruitwagen, R.F.P.M., Futterer, J.J., Vergeldt, T.F.M., Does three-dimensional anatomy improve student understanding?

We also aimed to estimate preliminary treatment effects of VR compared with an active distraction control (iPad). Materials and Methods: A single-site pilot randomized controlled trial comparing VR to iPad distraction was conducted. Eligible children and adolescents were aged 8 to 18 years undergoing treatment for cancer with upcoming SCP needle insertions. Intervention acceptability was evaluated by child, parent, and nurse self-report. Preliminary effectiveness outcomes included child-reported pain intensity, distress, and fear. Preliminary effectiveness was determined using logistic regression models with outcomes compared between groups using preprocedure scores as covariates. Results: Twenty participants (mean age 12 y) were randomized to each group. The most common diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=23, 58%). Most eligible children and adolescents (62%) participated, and 1 withdrew after randomization to the iPad group. Nurses, parents, and children reported the interventions in both groups to be acceptable, with the VR participants reporting significantly higher immersion in the distraction environment (P=0.0318). Although not statistically significant, more VR group participants indicated no pain (65% vs. 45%) and no distress (80% vs. 47%) during the procedure compared with the iPad group. Fear was similar across groups, with 60% of the sample indicating no fear. Discussion: VR was feasible and acceptable to implement as an intervention during SCP access. Preliminary effectiveness results indicate that VR may reduce distress and distress compared with iPad distraction. These data will inform design of a future full-scale randomized controlled trial. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Several studies started to analyse the accuracy of virtual reality tracking systems, but they did not consider in depth the effects of external interferences in the working area. In line with that, this study aimed at exploring the static-positional accuracy and the robustness to occlusions inside the capture volume of the SteamVR (1.0) tracking system. To do so, we ran 3 different tests in which we acquired the position of HTC Vive PRO Trackers (2018 version) on specific points of a grid drawn on the floor, in regular tracking conditions and with partial and total occlusions. The tracking system showed a high inter- and intra-rater reliability and detected a tilted surface with respect to the floor plane. Every acquisition was characterised by an initial random offset. We estimated an average accuracy of 0.5 ± 0.2 cm across the entire grid (XY-plane), noticing that the central points were more accurate (0.4 ± 0.1 cm) than the outer ones (0.6 ± 0.1 cm). For the Z-axis, the measurements showed greater variability and the accuracy was equal to 1.7 ± 1.2 cm. Occlusion response was tested using nonparametric Bland–Altman statistics, which highlighted the robustness of the tracking system. In conclusion, our results promote the SteamVR system for static measures in the clinical field. The computed error can be considered clinically irrelevant for exercises aimed at the rehabilitation of functional movements, whose several motor outcomes are generally measured on the scale of metres. © 2021, The Author(s).",Accuracy testing; HTC Vive PRO; SteamVR tracking; Tracker occlusion; Validation Study [Publication Type]; Virtual reality,Floors; Tracking (position); Accuracy testing; HTC vive PRO; Immersive virtual reality; Low-costs; Positional accuracy; Steamvr tracking; Tracker occlusion; Tracking system; Validation study; Validation study [publication type]; Virtual reality,"Ameler, T., Blohme, K., Brandt, L., A comparative evaluation of SteamVR Tracking and the OptiTrack system for medical device tracking (2019) 2019 41St Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), pp. 1465-1470; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical (2010) Measurement, 9; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Measuring agreement in method comparison studies (1999) Stat Methods Med Res, 8, pp. 135-160; Borges, M., Symington, A., Coltin, B., HTC Vive: Analysis and accuracy improvement (2018) 2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pp. 2610-2615; Campo-Prieto, P., Cancela, J.M., Rodríguez-Fuentes, G., Immersive virtual reality as physical therapy in older adults: present or future (systematic review) (2021) Virtual Real; Cipresso, P., Giglioli, I.A.C., Raya, M.A., Riva, G., The past, present, and future of virtual and augmented reality research: a network and cluster analysis of the literature (2018) Front Psychol; Conconi, M., Pompili, A., Sancisi, N., Parenti-Castelli, V., Quantification of the errors associated with marker occlusion in stereophotogrammetric systems and implications on gait analysis (2021) J Biomech, 114; Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap Methods and Their Application, , Cambridge University Press; Giavarina, D., Understanding Bland Altman analysis (2015) Biochem Med, 25, pp. 141-151; Hemphill, S., Nguyen, A., Rodriguez, S.T., Mobilization and calibration of the HTC VIVE for virtual reality physical therapy (2020) Digit Health, 6. , 2055207620950929; Corp, H.T.C., 2020) 2Q29100 HTC Vive Headset User Manual; Corp, H.T.C., (2017); Ikbal, M.S., Ramadoss, V., Zoppi, M., Dynamic pose tracking performance evaluation of htc vive virtual reality system (2021) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 3798-3815; Izard, S.G., Juanes, J.A., García Peñalvo, F.J., Virtual reality as an educational and training tool for medicine (2018) J Med Syst, 42, p. 50; Jiménez Bascones, J.L., Graña, M., Lopez-Guede, J.M., Robust labeling of human motion markers in the presence of occlusions (2019) Neurocomputing, 353, pp. 96-105; Jost, T.A., Drewelow, G., Koziol, S., Rylander, J., A quantitative method for evaluation of 6 degree of freedom virtual reality systems (2019) J Biomech, 97; Jung, K., Lee, J., Gupta, V., Cho, G., Comparison of bootstrap confidence interval methods for GSCA using a monte carlo simulation (2019) Front Psychol; Laut, J., Cappa, F., Nov, O., Porfiri, M., Increasing patient engagement in rehabilitation exercises using computer-based citizen science (2015) PLoS ONE, 10; Lombard, M., Ditton, T., At the heart of it all: the concept of presence (1997) J Comput-Mediat Commun, 3, p. 34; Maciejewski, M., Piszczek, M., Pomianek, M., (2018) Testing the Steamvr Trackers Operation Correctness with the Optitrack System; Maciejewski, M., Piszczek, M., Pomianek, M., Pałka, N., Design and evaluation of a steamvr tracker for training applications – simulations and measurements (2020) Metrol Measur Syst, 27, pp. 601-614; Nabiyouni, M., Scerbo, S., Bowman, D.A., Höllerer, T., Relative effects of real-world and virtual-world latency on an augmented reality training task: an AR simulation experiment (2017) Front ICT; Niehorster, D.C., Li, L., Lappe, M., The accuracy and precision of position and orientation tracking in the HTC vive virtual reality system for scientific research (2017) i-Perception; Paternain, S., Tailanian, M., Canetti, R., Calibration of an inertial measurement unit (2013) 2013 16Th International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR).

Design: Within-subjects repeated-measures design. Setting: Participants interacted with VRSIM-2 through 2 display options (desktop monitor vs immersive virtual reality screens) using 2 control interfaces (roller system vs conventional movement-sensing joystick), providing 4 different driving scenarios (driving conditions 1-4). Participants: performed 3 virtual driving sessions for each of the 2 display screens and 1 session through a real-world driving course (driving condition 5). The virtual PMRT was conducted in a simulated indoor office space, and an equivalent course was charted in an open space for the real-world assessment. After every change in driving condition, participants completed a self-reported workload assessment questionnaire, the Task Load Index, developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Participants: A convenience sample of electric-powered wheelchair (EPW) athletes (N=21) recruited at the 31st National Veterans Wheelchair Games. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Total composite PMRT score. Results: The PMRT had high interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]>.75) between the 2 raters in all 5 driving conditions. Post hoc analyses revealed that the reliability analyses had >80% power to detect high ICCs in driving conditions 1 and 4. Conclusions: The PMRT has high interrater reliability in conditions 1 and 4 and could be used to assess EPW driving performance virtually in VRSIM-2. However, further psychometric assessment is necessary to assess the feasibility of administering the PMRT using the different interfaces of VRSIM-2. © 2016 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.",Durable medical equipment; Neurological rehabilitation; Process assessment (health care); Rehabilitation; Reproducibility of results; Simulation training; Virtual reality exposure therapy; Wheelchairs,adult; Article; athlete; brain computer interface; car driving; driving ability; female; government; human; human experiment; interrater reliability; male; power mobility road test; powered wheelchair; questionnaire; scoring system; self report; simulator; virtual reality; virtual reality based simulator version 2; workload; aged; computer interface; computer simulation; disabled person; equipment design; middle aged; observer variation; physiotherapy; power supply; rehabilitation; reproducibility; standards; wheelchair; Adult; Aged; Computer Simulation; Disabled Persons; Electric Power Supplies; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Physical Therapy Modalities; Reproducibility of Results; User-Computer Interface; Wheelchairs,"Sapey, B., Stewart, J., Donaldson, G., The social implications of increases in wheelchair use (2004) Department of Applied Social Science, , Lancaster University Lancaster; LaPlante, M.P., Kaye, H.S., Demographics and trends in wheeled mobility equipment use and accessibility in the community (2010) Assist Technol, 22, pp. 3-17. , quiz 19; Brault, M.W., (2005) Americans with Disabilities.

A novel system was developed to fulfil the requirements of modern medical education and overcome the challenges faced by both students and lecturers in the process of knowledge transfer. A heart three-dimensional model presented in a virtual reality (VR) environment has been implemented in order to facilitate a new educational modality. This paper reports the outcome of a comparative study between traditional medical teaching modalities and virtual reality technology. This study was conducted in the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Jordan. The participants were asked to perform system trials and experiment with the system by navigating through the system interfaces, as well as being exposed to the traditional physical model of the human heart that is currently used in the faculty during practical anatomy sessions. Afterwards, they were asked to provide feedback via a comparative questionnaire. The participants’ replies to the questions regarding the Physical Heart Model and VR heart anatomy system were assessed for reliability using Cronbach’s alpha. The first group’s (Physical Heart Model questions) α value was 0.689. The second group’s (VR heart anatomy system questions) α value was 0.791. Comparing students’ experience results between the traditional method (Physical Heart Model) and the VR heart anatomy system, the mean scores showed a distinct increase in the values. This indicates that the developed system enhanced their experience in anatomy learning and the provided tools improved their understanding of heart anatomy. Results demonstrated the usefulness of the system by showing a higher satisfaction rate for the provided tools regarding structure and visualisation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Anatomy; Comparative study; Heart; Medical education; Virtual reality,Education computing; Heart; Knowledge management; Medical education; Students; Teaching; Virtual reality; Anatomy; Comparative studies; Knowledge transfer; Medical training; Satisfaction rates; System interfaces; Three-dimensional model; Virtual reality technology; E-learning,"Alfalah, S.F., Harrison, D.K., Charissis, V., Evans, D., An investigation of a healthcare management system with the use of multimodal interaction and 3D simulation: A technical note (2013) J Enterp Inf Manag, 26, pp. 183-197. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-39420-1_1; Alfalah, S.F., Harrison, D.K., Charissis, V., Gait analysis management and diagnosis in a prototype virtual reality environment (2013) Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality.

This research aims into the use of virtual reality (VR) in physical training and sports rigorous training to give students a new perspective on college training and educational training, as well as to improve the professional level and training excellence of college athletes. We present a revolutionary Virtual Reality-based Physical Training (VR-PT) technology for effective virtual reality instruction on a digital application. The semi-supervised learning framework was used to implement movement inputs and interactive reality methods. Virtual simulation and differentiated selection techniques based on Q statistical data are used first to identify sports students with excellent independent learning capacity, followed by the classifier’s neighbour reliability. Experiment results indicate that this strategy can successfully support physical training practices while also improving students’ learning performance. The effectiveness of students in athletics has increased by 30%. Simultaneously, two-thirds of people believe their involvement in athletic training has increased by 80%, and 90% of college coaches believe that using VR technology throughout physical training is extremely important for improving the technical aspect as well as the reliability of college sports training. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",gamification; physical training; Virtual reality technology,E-learning; Personnel training; Sports; Students; Supervised learning; Animation designs; Design technologies; Gamification; Immersive technologies; Multimedia tool; Physical training; Student learning; Tool technology; Virtual reality - Animation; Virtual reality technology; Virtual reality,"Alcalá, D.H., Garijo, A.H., Teaching games for understanding: A comprehensive approach to promote student’s motivation in physical education (2017) Journal of Human Kinetics, 59 (1), pp. 17-27. , https://doi.org/; Barbot, B., Kaufman, J.C., What makes immersive virtual reality the ultimate empathy machine?

The same phantoms were also measured using industry-standard image visualisation software packages. Two participants performed blinded measurements on volume-rendered images of standard phantoms both in VR and on an industry-standard image visualisation platform. The intra- and interrater reliability of the VR measurement method was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variance (CV). Measurement accuracy was analysed using Bland–Altman and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). VR measurements showed good intra- and interobserver reliability (ICC ≥ 0.99, p < 0.05; CV < 10%) across all imaging modalities. MAPE for VR measurements compared to ground truth were 1.6%, 1.6% and 7.7% in MRI, CT and 3DE datasets, respectively. Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated no systematic measurement bias in CT or MRI data in VR compared to ground truth. A small bias toward smaller measurements in 3DE data was seen in both VR (mean −0.52 mm [−0.16 to −0.88]) and the standard platform (mean −0.22 mm [−0.03 to −0.40]) when compared to ground truth. Limits of agreement for measurements across all modalities were similar in VR and standard software. This study has shown good measurement accuracy and reliability of VR in CT and MRI data with a higher MAPE for 3DE data. This may relate to the overall smaller measurement dimensions within the 3DE phantom. Further evaluation is required of all modalities for assessment of measurements <10 mm. © 2022 by the authors.",3D measurement tools; computed tomography; echocardiography; magnetic resonance imaging; measurement accuracy; preoperative imaging; virtual reality,Computerized tomography; Magnetic resonance imaging; Phantoms; Reliability; Virtual reality; Visualization; 3-D measurement; 3d measurement tool; Computed tomography; Ground truth; Imaging modality; Measurement accuracy; Measurement tools; Percentage error; Phantoms; Preoperative imaging; Echocardiography,"Lu, J.C., Ensing, G.J., Ohye, R.G., Romano, J.C., Sassalos, P., Owens, S.T., Thorsson, T., Si, M.-S., Stereoscopic Three-Dimensional Visualization for Congenital Heart Surgery Planning: Surgeons’ Perspectives (2020) J.

To improve data transmission technologies and develop solutions that will provide the required quality of service for VR traffic, a set of models should be developed that describe a new traffic type and user behavior. These models can be used to assess the impact of various network performance indicators (for example, channel bandwidth, packet transmission delays, and reliability of their delivery) on the quality of experience perceived by VR end user. The traffic properties of common VR applications are studied and a detailed and flexible VR application model is developed. The model can be used to generate VR video streams that have the same properties as those generated by existing VR applications. The effect of encoding parameters of a VR video stream on the efficiency of its delivery over a wireless network is examined. It is shown that the correct choice of these parameters significantly increases the network capacity compared with those used in existing cloud-based VR applications. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",interactive applications; Keywords: virtual reality; network capacity; simulation; video encoding,Behavioral research; Encoding (symbols); Network coding; Quality of service; Video streaming; Cloud-based; Interactive applications; Interactive virtual reality; Keyword: virtual reality; Network Capacity; Property; Quality-of-service; Service requirements; Simulation; Video encodings; Virtual reality,"McMahan, R.P., Bowman, D.A., Zielinski, D.J., Brady, R.B., Evaluating display fidelity and interaction fidelity in a virtual reality game (2012) IEEE Trans.

The secondary purpose of the study was to define which surgeons benefit from virtual reality training. Design Multicenter masked clinical trial. Participants Eighteen cataract surgeons with different levels of experience. Methods Cataract surgical training on a virtual reality simulator (EyeSi) until a proficiency-based test was passed. Main Outcome Measures Technical performance in the operating room (OR) assessed by 3 independent, masked raters using a previously validated task-specific assessment tool for cataract surgery (Objective Structured Assessment of Cataract Surgical Skill). Three surgeries before and 3 surgeries after the virtual reality training were video-recorded, anonymized, and presented to the raters in random order. Results Novices (non–independently operating surgeons) and surgeons having performed fewer than 75 independent cataract surgeries showed significant improvements in the OR—32% and 38%, respectively—after virtual reality training (P = 0.008 and P = 0.018). More experienced cataract surgeons did not benefit from simulator training. The reliability of the assessments was high with a generalizability coefficient of 0.92 and 0.86 before and after the virtual reality training, respectively.

The moderation effects of the autotelic and instrumental need for touch between touch simulation and VR store satisfaction are also explored. Participants wear a head-mounted display VR device (Oculus Go) in a controlled laboratory environment, and their VR store experience is recorded as data. All participants’ responses (n = 58) are analyzed using SPSS 20.0 for descriptive statistics, reliability analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and the Process macro model analysis. The results show that touch simulation positively influences VR store satisfaction, which is mediated by the self-efficacy and by the dual path of the self-efficacy and the pleasure. Furthermore, the relation between touch simulation and pleasure is moderated by need for touch. For individuals with a high level of autotelic need for touch, the effect of touch simulation on the pleasure is heightened. However, instrumental need for touch does not moderate the path of touch simulation on the self-efficacy. © 2022, The Author(s).",Autotelic need for touch; Instrumental need for touch; Need for touch (NFT); Pleasure; Self-efficacy; Touch simulation; Virtual reality (VR); VR store; VR store satisfaction,,"Abdullah, F., Ward, R., Developing a general extended technology acceptance model for e-learning (GETAMEL) by analysing commonly used external factors (2016) Computers in Human Behavior, 56, pp. 238-256; Ajzen, I., Perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, locus of control, and the theory of planned behavior 1 (2002) Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 32 (4), pp. 665-683; Ajzen, I., Fishbein, M., (1980) Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior, , Prentice Hall; Alshaer, A., Regenbrecht, H., O’Hare, D., Immersion factors affecting perception and behaviour in a virtual reality power wheelchair simulator (2017) Applied Ergonomics, 58, pp. 1-12; Altarteer, S., Charissis, V., Technology acceptance model for 3D virtual reality system in luxury brands online stores (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 64053-64062; Atakan, S.S., Consumer response to product construction: The role of haptic stimulation (2014) International Journal of Consumer Studies, 38 (6), pp. 586-592; Attiq, S., Rasool, H., Iqbal, S., The impact of supportive work environment, trust, and self-efficacy on organizational learning and its effectiveness: A stimulus-organism response approach (2017) Business & Economic Review, 9 (2), pp. 73-100; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Bandura, A., Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Bandura, A., Cultivate self-efficacy for personal and organizational effectiveness (2000) Handbook of Principles of Organizational Behavior, pp. 120-136. , Locke EA, (ed), Blackwell; Bar-Anan, Y., Liberman, N., Trope, Y., The association between psychological distance and construal level: Evidence from an implicit association test (2006) Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 135 (4), pp. 609-622; Barsalou, L.W., Grounded cognition (2008) Annual Review of Psychology, 59 (1), pp. 617-645; Barsalou, L.W., Simmons, W.K., Barbey, A.K., Wilson, C.D., Grounding conceptual knowledge in modality-specific systems (2003) Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7 (2), pp. 84-91; Baumgartner, H., Pieters, R., Bagozzi, R.P., Future-oriented emotions: Conceptualization and behavioral effects (2008) European Journal of Social Psychology, 38 (4), pp. 685-696; Bramley, I., Goode, A., Anderson, L., Mary, E., Researching in-store, at home: Using virtual reality within quantitative surveys (2018) International Journal of Market Research, 60 (4), pp. 344-351; Burns, M.J., How Adidas leveraged VR, Instagram for James Harden’s signature shoe launch (2016) Sporttechie, , https://www.sporttechie.com/how-adidas-leveraged-vr-and-instagram-for-james-hardens-signature-shoe-launch/, December 15; Lancôme & ByondXR—The future of pop-up stores (2021) BYONDXR, , https://www.byondxr.com/blog/media/virtual-popup-lancome/, January 24; Cahalane, M., Kirshner, S.N., Ting, A., Does virtual reality lower construal levels?

We included randomized controlled trials comparing VR interventions, alone or in combination, to control conditions or other active psychological interventions. Effects sizes (Hedges' g) for anxiety and depression outcomes, as post-Test and follow-up, were pooled with a random-effects model. Drop-outs were compared using odds ratio (OR) with a Mantel-Haenszel model. We included 39 trials (52 comparisons). Trial risk of bias was unclear for most domains, and high for incomplete outcome data. VR-based therapies were more effective than control at post-Test for anxiety, g = 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02, and depression, g = 0.73, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.21, but not for treatment attrition, OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.89. Heterogeneity was high and there was consistent evidence of small study effects. There were no significant differences between VR-based and other active interventions. VR interventions outperformed control conditions for anxiety and depression but did not improve treatment drop-out. High heterogeneity, potential publication bias, predominant use of waitlist controls, and high or uncertain risk of bias of most trials question the reliability of these effects. © 2018 The Author(s).",,anxiety; article; controlled study; follow up; human; meta analysis; patient dropout; publishing; randomized controlled trial (topic); reliability; systematic review; virtual reality; anxiety disorder; depression; odds ratio; pathology; treatment outcome; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Odds Ratio; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Virtual Reality,"Freeman, D., Virtual reality in the assessment, understanding, and treatment of mental health disorders (2017) Psychological Medicine, 47, pp. 2393-2400. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329171700040X; David, D., Matu, S.-A., David, O.A., New Directions in Virtual Reality-Based Therapy for Anxiety Disorders (2013) International Journal of Cognitive Therapy, 6, pp. 114-137. , https://doi.org/10.1521/ijct.2013.6.2.114; Gerardi, M., Cukor, J., Difede, J., Rizzo, A., Rothbaum, B.O., Virtual reality exposure therapy for post-Traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders (2010) Current Psychiatry Reports, 12, pp. 298-305. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-010-0128-4; Opris, D., Virtual reality exposure therapy in anxiety disorders: A quantitative meta-Analysis (2012) Depression and Anxiety, 29, pp. 85-93. , https://doi.org/10.1002/da.20910; Meyerbroker, K., Emmelkamp, P.M., Virtual reality exposure therapy in anxiety disorders: A systematic review of process-And-outcome studies (2010) Depression and Anxiety, 27, pp. 933-944. , https://doi.org/10.1002/da.20734; McCann, R.A., Virtual reality exposure therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders: An evaluation of research quality (2014) Journal of Anxiety Disorders, 28, pp. 625-631. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2014.05.010; Turner, W.A., Casey, L.M., Outcomes associated with virtual reality in psychological interventions: Where are we now?

The study objective was to establish validity evidence for a virtual reality simulator test of a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy of a right upper lobe. Methods: Participants with varying experience in VATS lobectomy were included. They were familiarized with a virtual reality simulator (LapSim®) and introduced to the steps of the procedure for a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy. The participants performed two VATS lobectomies on the simulator with a 5-min break between attempts. Nineteen pre-defined simulator metrics were recorded. Results: Fifty-three participants from nine different countries were included. High internal consistency was found for the metrics with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for standardized items of 0.91. Significant test–retest reliability was found for 15 of the metrics (p-values &lt;0.05). Significant correlations between the metrics and the participants VATS lobectomy experience were identified for seven metrics (p-values &lt;0.001), and 10 metrics showed significant differences between novices (0 VATS lobectomies performed) and experienced surgeons (&gt;50 VATS lobectomies performed). A pass/fail level defined as approximately one standard deviation from the mean metric scores for experienced surgeons passed none of the novices (0 % false positives) and failed four of the experienced surgeons (29 % false negatives). Conclusion: This study is the first to establish validity evidence for a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy virtual reality simulator test. Several simulator metrics demonstrated significant differences between novices and experienced surgeons and pass/fail criteria for the test were set with acceptable consequences. This test can be used as a first step in assessing thoracic surgery trainees’ VATS lobectomy competency. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Lobectomy; Validity; VATS; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Virtual reality simulation,"adult; Article; controlled study; Cronbach alpha coefficient; human; internal consistency; job performance; lobectomy; normal human; patient safety; priority journal; simulator; surgical training; test retest reliability; thorax surgery; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; virtual reality; clinical competence; computer assisted surgery; computer simulation; curriculum; education; female; lung resection; lung tumor; male; procedures; reproducibility; simulation training; standards; validation study; virtual reality; Adult; Clinical Competence; Competency-Based Education; Computer Simulation; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Pneumonectomy; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Virtual Reality","McGaghie, W.C., Research opportunities in simulation-based medical education using deliberate practice (2008) Acad Emerg Med, 15, pp. 995-1001. , PID: 18811635; Price, J., Naik, V., Boodhwani, M., Brandys, T., Hendry, P., Lam, B.B.K., A randomized evaluation of simulation training on performance of vascular anastomosis on a high-fidelity in vivo model: the role of deliberate practice (2011) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 142, pp. 496-503. , PID: 21742349; Marshall, M.B., Simulation for technical skills (2012) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 144, pp. S43-S47. , PID: 22898525; Crochet, P., Aggarwal, R., Dubb, S.S., Ziprin, P., Rajaretnam, N., Grantcharov, T., Ericsson, K.A., Darzi, A., Deliberate practice on a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator enhances the quality of surgical technical skills (2011) Ann Surg, 253, pp. 1216-1222. , PID: 21516035; Seymour, N.E., VR to OR: a review of the evidence that virtual reality simulation improves operating room performance (2008) World J Surg, 32, pp. 182-188. , PID: 18060453; Schijven, M.P., Jakimowicz, J.J., Broeders, I.A.M.J., Tseng, L.N.L., The Eindhoven laparoscopic cholecystectomy training course—improving operating room performance using virtual reality training: results from the first E.A.E.S. accredited virtual reality trainings curriculum (2005) Surg Endosc Other Interv Tech, 19, pp. 1220-1226. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2Mrnt1egtQ%3D%3D; Jensen, K., Bjerrum, F., Hansen, H.J., Petersen, R.H., Pedersen, J.H., Konge, L., A new possibility in thoracoscopic virtual reality simulation training: development and testing of a novel virtual reality simulator for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy (2015) Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg, 21, pp. 420-426. , PID: 26162895; Seymour, N.E., Røtnes, J.S., Challenges to the development of complex virtual reality surgical simulations (2006) Surg Endosc Other Interv Tech, 20, pp. 1774-1777. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD28nlslOgtw%3D%3D; Jensen, K., Ringsted, C., Hansen, H.J., Petersen, R.H., Konge, L., Simulation-based training for thoracoscopic lobectomy: a randomized controlled trial: virtual-reality versus black-box simulation (2014) Surg Endosc Other Interv Tech, 28, pp. 1821-1829; Bjerrum, F., Sorensen, J.L., Konge, L., Rosthøj, S., Lindschou, J., Ottesen, B., Strandbygaard, J., Randomized clinical trial to examine procedure-to-procedure transfer in laparoscopic simulator training (2016) Br J Surg, 103, pp. 44-50. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BC28zmsVCqtQ%3D%3D, PID: 26511775; Carpenter, A.J., Yang, S.C., Uhlig, P.N., Colson, Y.L., Envisioning simulation in the future of thoracic surgical education (2008) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 135, pp. 477-484. , PID: 18329455; Verrier, E.D., Joint Council on Thoracic Surgical Education: an investment in our future (2011) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 141, pp. 318-321. , PID: 21241854; Moon, M.R., Technical skills assessment in thoracic surgery education: we won’t get fooled again (2014) J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 148, pp. 2497-2498. , PID: 25439480; Lodge, D., Grantcharov, T., Training and assessment of technical skills and competency in cardiac surgery (2011) Eur J Cardiothorac Surg, 39, pp. 287-293. , PID: 20724174; Aggarwal, R., Darzi, A., Simulation to enhance patient safety: Why aren’t we there yet?

Materials and methods: Virtual reality glasses, a smartphone with a 6 inch display, and software that implements a fast-threshold 3 dB step staircase algorithm for the central 24° of visual field (52 points) were used to test 20 eyes of 10 patients, who were tested in a random and consecutive order as they appeared in our glaucoma department. The results were compared with those obtained from the same patients using the Humphrey perimeter. Results: High correlation coefficient (r=0.808, P<0.0001) was found between the virtual reality visual field test and the Humphrey perimeter visual field. Conclusion: Visual field examination results using virtual reality glasses have a high correlation with the Humphrey perimeter allowing the method to be suitable for probable clinical use. © 2017 Tsapakis et al.",Perimetry; Smartphone; Virtual reality glasses; Visual fields; Visual fields software,Article; clinical article; controlled study; equipment design; eye examination; human; Humphrey perimeter; intermethod comparison; male; perimetry; smartphone; spectacles; virtual reality; virtual reality glasses,"Brouzas, D., Tsapakis, S., Nitoda, E., Moschos, M.M., Visual field examination using a video projector: Comparison with Humphrey perimeter (2014) Clin Ophthalmol, 8, pp. 523-528; John, R., Kasha, Jr., John, R., (1998) Visual Field Perimetry Using Virtual Reality Glasses, , United States patent US5737060A, Apr 7; Chan, A.D.C., Eizenman, M., Flanagan, J., Trope, G., Head-Mounted Perimetry, , Vision Science and Its Applications; OSA Technical Digest Series, Optical Society of America; February 19, 1999; Washington, DC: USA.

Recently, the growing awareness of the need for patient safety has brought simulation training to the forefront. Simulation training can provide trainees with the chance to practice their skills in a learner-centred, risk-free environment. It is important to ensure that skills gained through simulation positively transfer to the clinical environment. This updated review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulation training in gastrointestinal endoscopy. Objectives: To determine whether virtual reality simulation training can supplement and/or replace early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. Search methods: We searched the following health professions, educational, and computer databases until 12 July 2017: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, AMED, ERIC, Education Full Text, CBCA Education, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Abstracts in New Technology and Engineering, Computer and Information Systems Abstracts, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global. We also searched the grey literature until November 2017. Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised clinical trials comparing VR endoscopy simulation training versus any other method of endoscopy training with outcomes measured on humans in the clinical setting, including conventional patient-based training, training using another form of endoscopy simulation, or no training. We also included trials comparing two different methods of VR training. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of trials, and extracted data on the trial characteristics and outcomes. We pooled data for meta-analysis where participant groups were similar, studies assessed the same intervention and comparator, and had similar definitions of outcome measures. We calculated risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes when studies reported the same or different outcome measures, respectively. We used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence. Main results: We included 18 trials (421 participants; 3817 endoscopic procedures). We judged three trials as at low risk of bias. Ten trials compared VR training with no training, five trials with conventional endoscopy training, one trial with another form of endoscopy simulation training, and two trials compared two different methods of VR training. Due to substantial clinical and methodological heterogeneity across our four comparisons, we did not perform a meta-analysis for several outcomes. We rated the quality of evidence as moderate, low, or very low due to risk of bias, imprecision, and heterogeneity. Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus no training: There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect on composite score of competency (MD 3.10, 95% CI -0.16 to 6.36; 1 trial, 24 procedures; low-quality evidence). Composite score of competency was based on 5-point Likert scales assessing seven domains: atraumatic technique, colonoscope advancement, use of instrument controls, flow of procedure, use of assistants, knowledge of specific procedure, and overall performance. Scoring range was from 7 to 35, a higher score representing a higher level of competence. Virtual reality training compared to no training likely provides participants with some benefit, as measured by independent procedure completion (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.26; 6 trials, 815 procedures; moderate-quality evidence). We evaluated overall rating of performance (MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.75; 1 trial, 18 procedures), visualisation of mucosa (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.00; 1 trial, 55 procedures), performance time (MD -0.20 minutes, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.30; 2 trials, 29 procedures), and patient discomfort (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.68 to 0.35; 2 trials, 145 procedures), all with very low-quality evidence. No trials reported procedure-related complications or critical flaws (e.g. bleeding, luminal perforation) (3 trials, 550 procedures; moderate-quality evidence). Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus conventional patient-based training: One trial reported composite score of competency but did not provide sufficient data for quantitative analysis. Virtual reality training compared to conventional patient-based training resulted in fewer independent procedure completions (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74; 2 trials, 174 procedures; low-quality evidence). We evaluated performance time (SMD 0.12, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.80; 2 trials, 34 procedures), overall rating of performance (MD -0.90, 95% CI -4.40 to 2.60; 1 trial, 16 procedures), and visualisation of mucosa (MD 0.0, 95% CI -6.02 to 6.02; 1 trial, 18 procedures), all with very low-quality evidence. Virtual reality training in combination with conventional training appears to be advantageous over VR training alone. No trials reported any procedure-related complications or critical flaws (3 trials, 72 procedures; very low-quality evidence). Virtual reality endoscopy simulation training versus another form of endoscopy simulation: Based on one study, there were no differences between groups with respect to composite score of competency, performance time, and visualisation of mucosa. Virtual reality training in combination with another form of endoscopy simulation training did not appear to confer any benefit compared to VR training alone. Two methods of virtual reality training: Based on one study, a structured VR simulation-based training curriculum compared to self regulated learning on a VR simulator appears to provide benefit with respect to a composite score evaluating competency. Based on another study, a progressive-learning curriculum that sequentially increases task difficulty provides benefit with respect to a composite score of competency over the structured VR training curriculum. Authors' conclusions: VR simulation-based training can be used to supplement early conventional endoscopy training for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. However, we found insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of VR simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training. The quality of the current evidence was low due to inadequate randomisation, allocation concealment, and/or blinding of outcome assessment in several trials. Further trials are needed that are at low risk of bias, utilise outcome measures with strong evidence of validity and reliability, and examine the optimal nature and duration of training. © 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"awareness; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; colonoscopy; computer simulation; conceptual framework; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; gastrointestinal endoscopy; health education; health practitioner; human; methodology; motor performance; mucosa; outcome assessment; priority journal; Review; risk factor; sigmoidoscopy; systematic review; virtual reality; clinical competence; education; gastrointestinal endoscopy; health care personnel; meta analysis; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); simulation training; Clinical Competence; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Health Personnel; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Simulation Training; Virtual Reality","Ahlberg, G., Hultcrantz, R., Jaramillo, E., Lindblom, A., Arvidsson, D., Virtual reality colonoscopy simulation: a compulsory practice for the future colonoscopist?

Among the most common sensorimotor symptoms of mTBI is balance impairment. A commonly used assessments of balance following mTBI is the sensory organization test (SOT). This test has shown that postural deficits following head injury may be due to visual-vestibular processing issues, but it is less sensitive to unremitting symptoms that do not spontaneously resolve within a week. Our current project involves demonstrating validity and reliability of a novel low-cost, portable virtual reality-based balance screening device that employs established principles of sensorimotor reweighting and visual-vestibular integration. The goal is to determine if it can replace existing tools that are either prohibitively expensive or lack reliability or sensitivity. Methods: Healthy adults with no known musculoskeletal or neurological injury (n=27; 17 males, 10 females; 22.1+3.9 years) were tested to establish healthy norms. Individuals with mTBI (n=8; 4 males, 4 females; 20.0+1.7 years) were compared to the healthy norms. The new VR-based balance assessment system consists of a Wii balance board (WBB), a large screen television, and a custom-designed software user interface used to collect and process data. Subjects performed six upright postural tasks (three visual conditions either standing directly on the WBB or on foam placed on the WBB). Subjects viewed a virtual reality scene displayed on a 60 television. The three visual conditions were Static Scene, Dark Scene, and Dynamic Scene (Roll at 60 deg/s). The WBB recorded COP at 100Hz for 30 sec. Dependent variables included COP velocity, root mean square, and sway area. Subjects also performed the sensory organization test (SOT), which can be used as criterion-measures for intraclass correlations with the new device. Results: Preliminary data on healthy subjects validates effectiveness of the device to reduce postural stability as sensory input reliability and availability decreases. Additionally, ur results reveal that individuals with mTBI have significantly worse balance scores on the new VR-device (p<0.001). This highlights its sensitivity to balance disturbance even if when testing a small sample. Comparison of the new device to SOT shows good criterion validity with ROC curves revealing sensitivity/specificity equal or higher than the SOT. COP sway area, velocity, and standard deviation of medial-lateral and anterior-posterior sway were all sensitive dependent variables. In conclusion, this study helps demonstrate that our new VR-based assessment tool is a valid measure for detecting balance related changes in neurologically impaired individuals and can potentially replace much more expensive equipment. Using postural control as an outcome measure of brain injury may help improve identification of individuals with sub-acute symptoms which may be used to guide rehabilitation and clinical decision-making. © 2015 IEEE.",concussion; vestibular; virtual environment; visual,Brain; Decision making; Ergonomics; Reliability; User interfaces; Clinical decision making; concussion; Identification of individuals; Intraclass correlations; Mild traumatic brain injuries; Reliability and availability; vestibular; visual; Virtual reality,"Harmon, K.G., Drezner, J.A., Gammons, M., Guskiewicz, K., Halstead, M., Kutcher, J.S., American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: Concussion in sport (2013) Br J Sport Med, 47, pp. 15-26; McCrory, P., Meeuwisse, W., Aubry, M., Cantu, R., Dvorak, J., Echmendia, R.J., Consensus statement on concussion in sport: The 4international conference on concussion in sport held in Zurich, November, 2012 (2013) Br J Sport Med, 47, pp. 250-258; Murray, N., Salvatore, A., Powell, D., Reed-Jones, R., Reliability and validity evidence of multiple balance assessments in atheltes with a concusison (2014) J Athl Train., 49 (4), pp. 540-549; Cavanaugh, J.T., Guskiewicz, K.M., Giuliani, C., Marshall, S., Mercer, V., Stergiou, N., Detecting altered postural control after cerebral concussion in athletes with normal postural stability (2005) Br J Sports Med., 39, pp. 805-811; Guskiewicz, K.M., Riemann, B.L., Perrin, D.H., Nashner, L.M., Alternative approaches to the assessment of mild head injury in athletes (1997) Med Sci Sports Exerc., 29 (7), pp. S213-S221. , Jul; Guskiewicz, K.M., Ross, S.E., Marshall, S.W., Postural stability and neuropsychological deficits after concussion in collegiate athletes (2001) J Athl Train., 36, pp. 263-273; McCrea, M., Guskiewicz, K.M., Marshall, S.W., Barr, W., Randolph, C., Acute effects and recovery time following concussion in collegiate football players: The NCAA concussion study (2003) JAMA., 290, pp. 2556-2563; Register-Mihalik, J.K., Mihalik, J.P., Guskiewicz, K.M., Balance deficits after sports-related concussion in individuals reporting posttraumatic head-ache (2008) Neurosurgery., 63, pp. 76-80. , discussion 80-82; Riemann, B.L., Guskiewicz, K.M., Shields, E.W., Relationship between clinical and forceplate measures of postural stability (1999) J Sport Rehabil., 8, pp. 71-82; Baker, C.S., Cinelli, M.E., Visuomotor deficits during locomotion in previously concussed athletes 30 or more days following return to play (2014) Physiol Rep., 2 (12), pp. 1-7. , Dec 24; Howell, D.R., Osternig, L.R., Chou, L.S., Return to activity after concussion affects dual-task gait balance control recovery (2014) Med Sci Sports Exerc, , Aug 5.

With regard to clinical neuropsychology, a multitude of new VR applications are being developed to overcome the limitations of classical paradigms. Consequently, researchers increasingly face the challenge of systematically evaluating the characteristics and quality of VR applications to design the optimal paradigm for their specific research question and study population. However, the multifaceted character of contemporary VR is not adequately captured by the traditional quality criteria (ie, objectivity, reliability, validity), highlighting the need for an extended paradigm evaluation framework. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional evaluation framework for VR applications in clinical neuropsychology, summarized as an easy-to-use checklist (VR-Check). This framework rests on 10 main evaluation dimensions encompassing cognitive domain specificity, ecological relevance, technical feasibility, user feasibility, user motivation, task adaptability, performance quantification, immersive capacities, training feasibility, and predictable pitfalls. We show how VR-Check enables systematic and comparative paradigm optimization by illustrating its application in an exemplary research project on the assessment of spatial cognition and executive functions with immersive VR. This application furthermore demonstrates how the framework allows researchers to identify across-domain trade-offs, makes deliberate design decisions explicit, and optimizes the allocation of study resources. Complementing recent approaches to standardize clinical VR studies, the VR-Check framework enables systematic and project-specific paradigm optimization for behavioral and cognitive research in neuropsychology. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Patrol robot is a comprehensive system with environmental awareness, route planning, dynamic decision making, behavior decision making and so on [1]. The existing patrols are mainly inefficient manual patrols and it is a viable solution to make patrol robots achieve regular, fixed patrol or interrupted patrol in a complex environment. As a technology with excellent human-computer interaction, virtual reality can be applied to patrol robots and it can improve efficiency and reliability of patrol task. Based on the modeling of known patrol environment, 3 modules based on C++ programming language, which include virtual display module, registration module based on OpenCV visual library, robot remote control module based on TCP/IP protocol, were developed in the paper.

With the rise of new technologies and increasing needs for neurorehabilitation, an interest in virtual reality has emerged. In this context, we have developed an immersive virtual reality version of the Box and Block Test (BBT-VR). The aim of this study was to assess the concurrent validity of the BBT-VR among patients with stroke and healthy participants. Methods: Twenty-three healthy participants and 22 patients with stroke were asked to perform the classical Box and Block Test (BBT) and BBT-VR three times with both hands. Concurrent validity was assessed through correlations between these two tests and reliability of the BBT-VR through correlation on test–retest. Usability of the BBT-VR was also evaluated with the System Usability Scale. Hand kinematic data extracted from controller’s 3D position allowed to compute mean velocity (Vmean), peak velocity (Vpeak) and smoothness (SPARC). Results: Results showed strong correlations between the number of blocks displaced with the BBT and the BBT-VR among patients with stroke for affected (r = 0.89; p &lt; 0.001) and less-affected hands (r = 0.76; p &lt; 0.001) and healthy participants for dominant (r = 0.58; p &lt; 0.01) and non-dominant hands (r = 0.68; p &lt; 0.001). Reliability for test–retest was excellent (ICC &gt; 0.8; p &lt; 0.001) and usability almost excellent (System Usability Scale = 79 ± 12.34%). On average participants moved between 30 and 40% less blocks during the BBT-VR than during the BBT. Healthy participants demonstrated significantly higher kinematic measures (Vmean = 0.22 ± 0.086 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.96 ± 0.341 ms−1; SPARC = − 3.31 ± 0.862) than patients with stroke (Vmean = 0.12 ± 0.052 ms−1; Vpeak = 0.60 ± 0.202 ms−1; SPARC = − 5.04[− 7.050 to − 3.682]). Conclusion: The BBT-VR is a usable, valid and reliable test to assess manual dexterity, providing kinematic parameters, in a population of patients with stroke and healthy participants.

These applications require different tracking performance, often measured as spatial accuracy and precision. While manufacturers report data quality estimates for their devices, these typically represent ideal performance and may not reflect real-world data quality. Additionally, it is unclear how accuracy and precision change across sessions within the same participant or between devices, and how performance is influenced by vision correction. Here, we measured spatial accuracy and precision of the Vive Pro Eye built-in eye tracker across a range of 30 visual degrees horizontally and vertically. Participants completed ten measurement sessions over multiple days, allowing to evaluate calibration reliability. Accuracy and precision were highest for central gaze and decreased with greater eccentricity in both axes. Calibration was successful in all participants, including those wearing contacts or glasses, but glasses yielded significantly lower performance. We further found differences in accuracy (but not precision) between two Vive Pro Eye headsets, and estimated participants’ inter-pupillary distance. Our metrics suggest high calibration reliability and can serve as a baseline for expected eye tracking performance in VR experiments. © This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license",Accuracy; Eye tracking; Head-mounted display; Precision; Virtual reality,,"Adhanom, I., Lee, S.

The purpose of this study was to assess how leisure satisfaction with leisure sports and degree of sustainable participation affect men and women in actual sports and virtual reality (VR) sports. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to confirm scale validity and reliability, and multivariate analysis of variance and multiple regression were conducted for comparative analysis and linear relationships between variances. The results showed that while men typically participate in 'masculine' sports and women in 'feminine' sports, both genders equally enjoy the same types of VR sports. In terms of gender differences, female VR sport participants placed importance on educational leisure satisfaction and the intent of sustainable participation. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the physical, psychological, or social leisure satisfaction factors, indicating no differences in satisfaction between performing actual sports and those in the VR environment. In addition, all factors except relaxation factor, had a positive impact on intent of sustainable participation. This study implied that VR sports offer an opportunity for people to be together, regardless of gender, and that it is becoming a part of healthy leisure sports culture. © 2018 by the authors.",Gender differences; Leisure; Leisure satisfaction; Sustainable participation; VR sports,advanced technology; comparative study; education; factor analysis; gender; labor participation; life satisfaction; sport; sustainability; sustainable development,"Beier, K.P., (2018) Virtual Reality: A Short Introduction, , http://www-vrl.umich.edu, accessed on 7 July; Flynn, S., Palma, P., Bender, A., Feasibility using the Sony Playstation 2 Gaming Platform for an individual poststroke: A case report (2007) J.

The availability and reliability of these machines over a reasonable time span will be largely dependent on the planning of the remote maintenance scheme. The efficiency of the remote maintenance operations can be effectively increased by designing specialized remote handling control systems with high precision and accuracy. Huge efforts are needed to equip the RH operators with the advanced technologies that provide the real knowledge and interactions with the operating environment without being physically present. This can be achieved by using virtual reality techniques for tele-presence that may be extremely beneficial for the offline training as well as in assisting during the online RH operations. This paper outlines a concept with prototype experiments for an interactive control system using virtual reality integration and haptic feedback. Virtual 3D models of the complete work-cell have been developed and are updated synchronously for the monitoring and controlling of the robotic equipment. Force reflection servo type control strategy has been employed for the master-slave control. The proposed control system architecture and results from various test cases have been summarized here. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Haptic feedback; Remote handling; Robotics; Virtual reality,Maintenance; Materials handling; Remote control; Robotics; Tokamak devices; Virtual reality; Control system architecture; Force reflection servo type control strategy; Haptic feedbacks; Monitoring and controlling; Operating environment; Prototype experiment; Remote handling; Virtual reality techniques; Feedback,"R. and the I.D. team Srinivasan, Conceptual study of Indian fusion power plant (2008) Proc. 2nd IAEA Tech.

Although advances in Computer Graphics (CG), Computer Vision (CV), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to address a wide range of human needs, fully integrated systems that consider age-related changes in elderly people are still pretty uncommon. In this work, we present a WAT that follows interaction design guidelines to ensure reliability, usability, and suitability for everyday use. The WAT enables elderly people to improve interactions with Mixed Reality (MR) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. It properly aids and assists elderly people in daily activities such as analysing the environment, recognising and searching for objects, wayfinding, and navigation. We believe that this technology is helpful for blind, low-vision, or hearing-impaired independent elderly people to improve their quality of life while maintaining self-independence. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Assistive technology; Elderly people; Internet of things; Mixed reality,Audition; Automation; Interactive computer graphics; Internet of things; Wearable technology; Age-related changes; Assistive technology; Assistive technology for elderly people; Elderly people; Fully integrated; Hearing impaired; Interaction design; Internet of Things (IOT); Mixed reality,"De Belen, R.A., Bednarz, T., Mixed reality and internet of things (mriot) interface design guidelines for elderly people (2019) 2019 23rd International Conference in Information Visualization-Part II.

The model assessment process in the hybrid vehicle modeling assessment becomes more in-depth, and designers exchange ideas. The critical aspect of automotive modeling is that various models have varying views on vehicle styling. The evaluation process is long, complicated, and efficient in automotive simulation. The evaluation process takes time. Therefore, in the paper, an Automobile Modelling Optimization Design Based on Virtual Reality Technology (AMOD-VRT) is proposed to improve automobile modeling and design research to be more interactive. Computational Design Method is used to create and design the entire vehicle as well as its surrounding environment. An Integrated Virtual Analysis can enclose the models mentioned above and create a virtual environment in which the user can interact to design a model virtually by themselves. The paper provides complete virtual design modeling of an automobile, allowing the user to work more efficiently based on the results. By applying virtual reality technology in the automobile design phase, interactive and network-based remote research on automobile modeling can make the automobile design progression more appropriate, easier to communicate with designers and decrease automobile design's development cost and cycle. The simulation analysis is performed based on safety, performance, and efficiency, proving the reliability of the proposed framework. Various parameters obtain the simulation results on automobile design as the automobile vehicle design performance ratio is 87.16%, increasing the visual effects in AMOD ratio is 88.77%, improving visual effects with optimized design ratio is 84.5%, interaction and collaboration of automobile modeling ratio are 82.26% and reduce vehicles accident using virtual reality ratio is 93.80%. The computer-based virtual reality technology in the automotive industry can effectively accelerate new product development in the future. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Automobile; Automobile modeling; Design model; Optimization; Virtual platform; Virtual reality,Accidents; Automobiles; Automotive industry; Design; Product development; Reliability analysis; Automobile; Automobile design; Automobile models; Design models; Model assessment; Model optimization; Optimisations; Optimization design; Virtual platform; Virtual reality technology; Virtual reality,"Xu, Z., Zou, X., Oh, T., Vu, H.

Methods: Thirty participants (23 male/7 female) completed a diagnostic arthroscopy and a loose body retrieval simulation on the VirtaMed Arthros Hip Simulator (Zurich, Switzerland) twice at a minimum of 1 week apart. Subjects consisted of 12 novices (medical students, postgraduate year [PGY] 1-2), 5 intermediate trainees (PGY3-4), 9 senior trainees (PGY5 and fellows), and 4 attending faculty. Simulator metrics were recorded and then compiled to generate a total simulator score (TSS). The loose body retrieval was graded using the ASSET scoring tool. Inter-rater and intrarater reliability for the ASSET for 2 blinded raters and construct validity of the ASSET and the TSS were calculated. Correlation between the TSS, ASSET and individual simulator metrics was determined. Results: Prior simulation experience (P ≤ 0.01) correlated with higher TSS and higher ASSET, while video game experience correlated with higher TSS on the diagnostic module only (P = 0.004). There was a significant difference in ASSET score among all experience groups (P < 0.04). Novices had the lowest mean ASSET whereas experts had the highest mean ASSET with a difference of 17.4 points. Overall performance on the surgical module significantly correlated with the ASSET score (r = 0.444, P = 0.016). There was a significant positive correlation among higher ASSET and number of loose bodies retrieved, operation time, camera path and grasper path length, and percentage of cartilage injury. ASSET demonstrated excellent intrarater reliability and showed substantial or better inter-reliability in 8 of 9 domains. Conclusion: The VirtaMed hip arthroscopy simulator demonstrated good construct validity and excellent reliability for simulator-based metrics and ASSET score. Use of both simulator metrics and ASSET offers a more comprehensive performance assessment on hip arthroscopy simulation than either measure alone. Clinical Relevance: As virtual reality simulation for arthroscopy becomes more commonplace in orthopaedic training, evaluation of the most effective objective and subjective measures of performance is necessary to optimize simulation training. © 2021 Arthroscopy Association of North America",,adult; arthroscopic surgery; Arthroscopic Surgery Skill Evaluation Tool Global Rating Scale; Article; cartilage injury; construct validity; controlled study; experience; female; hip arthroscopy; human; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; male; medical student; operation duration; orthopedic surgeon; performance measurement system; postgraduate student; rating scale; scoring system; simulation training; skill; surgical training; video game; arthroscopy; clinical competence; computer simulation; reproducibility; virtual reality; Arthroscopy; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; Virtual Reality,"Camp, C.L., Krych, A.J., Stuart, M.J., Regnier, T.D., Mills, K.M., Turner, N.S., Improving resident performance in knee arthroscopy: a prospective value assessment of simulators and cadaveric skills laboratories (2016) J Bone Joint Surg Am, 98, pp. 220-225; Rebolledo, B.J., Hammann-Scala, J., Leali, A., Ranawat, A.S., Arthroscopy skills development with a surgical simulator: a comparative study in orthopaedic surgery residents (2015) Am J Sports Med, 43, pp. 1526-1529; Roberts, C.S., Hunter, A.M., Flying blind in American orthopaedic surgery: the urgent need for an educational curriculum in orthopaedic surgery residency training (2014) Injury, 45, pp. 465-466; Dougherty, P.J., Marcus, R.E., ACGME and ABOS changes for the orthopaedic surgery PGY-1 (intern) year (2013) Clin Orthop Relat Res, 471, pp. 3412-3416; Tay, C., Khajuria, A., Gupte, C., Simulation training: a systematic review of simulation in arthroscopy and proposal of a new competency-based training framework (2014) Int J Surg, 12, pp. 626-633; Frank, R.M., Wang, K.C., Davey, A., Utility of modern arthroscopic simulator training models: a meta-analysis and updated systematic review (2018) Arthroscopy, 34, pp. 1650-1677; Gomoll, A.H., O'Toole, R.V., Czarnecki, J., Warner, J.J., Surgical experience correlates with performance on a virtual reality simulator for shoulder arthroscopy (2007) Am J Sports Med, 35, pp. 883-888; Koehler, R.J., Amsdell, S., Arendt, E.A., The Arthroscopic Surgical Skill Evaluation Tool (ASSET) (2013) Am J Sports Med, 41, pp. 1229-1237; Van Nortwick, S.S., Lendvay, T.S., Jensen, A.R., Wright, A.S., Horvath, K.D., Kim, S., Methodologies for establishing validity in surgical simulation studies (2010) Surgery, 147, pp. 622-630; Koehler, R.J., Nicandri, G.T., Using the arthroscopic surgery skill evaluation tool as a pass-fail examination (2013) J Bone Joint Surg Am, 95, pp. e1871-e1876; Raja, A., Thomas, P., Harrison, A., Tompkins, M., Braman, J., Validation of assessing arthroscopic skill using the ASSET evaluation (2019) J Surg Educ, 76, pp. 1640-1644; Modi, C.S., Morris, G., Mukherjee, R., Computer-simulation training for knee and shoulder arthroscopic surgery (2010) Arthroscopy, 26, pp. 832-840; Srivastava, S., Youngblood, P.L., Rawn, C., Hariri, S., Heinrichs, W.L., Ladd, A.L., Initial evaluation of a shoulder arthroscopy simulator: establishing construct validity (2004) J Shoulder Elbow Surg, 13, pp. 196-205; Henn, R.F., 3rd, Shah, N., Warner, J.J., Gomoll, A.H., Shoulder arthroscopy simulator training improves shoulder arthroscopy performance in a cadaveric model (2013) Arthroscopy, 29, pp. 982-985; Dunn, J.C., Belmont, P.J., Lanzi, J., Arthroscopic shoulder surgical simulation training curriculum: transfer reliability and maintenance of skill over time (2015) J Surg Educ, 72, pp. 1118-1123; Bauer, D.E., Wieser, K., Aichmair, A., Zingg, P.O., Dora, C., Rahm, S., Validation of a virtual reality-based hip arthroscopy simulator (2019) Arthroscopy, 35, pp. 789-795; Rahm, S., Wieser, K., Bauer, D.E., Efficacy of standardized training on a virtual reality simulator to advance knee and shoulder arthroscopic motor skills (2018) BMC Musculoskelet Disord, 19, p. 150; Ode, G., Loeffler, B., Chadderdon, R.C., Wrist arthroscopy: can we gain proficiency through knee arthroscopy simulation?

However, there are some technical and methodological pitfalls. The American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN) and the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN) raised 8 key issues pertaining to Computerized Neuropsychological Assessment Devices. These issues pertain to: (1) the safety and effectivity; (2) the identity of the end-user; (3) the technical hardware and software features; (4) privacy and data security; (5) the psychometric properties; (6) examinee issues; (7) the use of reporting services; and (8) the reliability of the responses and results. The VR Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL) is the first immersive VR neuropsychological battery with enhanced ecological validity for the assessment of everyday cognitive functions by offering a pleasant testing experience without inducing cybersickness. The VR-EAL meets the criteria of the NAN and AACN, addresses the methodological pitfalls, and brings advantages for neuropsychological testing. However, there are still shortcomings of the VR-EAL, which should be addressed. Future iterations should strive to improve the embodiment illusion in VR-EAL and the creation of an open access VR software library should be attempted. The discussed studies demonstrate the utility of VR methods in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology. © 2021 The Authors",Ethical standards; Methodology; Neuropsychological assessment; Safety; Usability; Virtual reality,,"American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN) practice guidelines for neuropsychological assessment and consultation (2007) Clinical Neuropsychology, 21 (2), pp. 209-231; Record keeping guidelines (2007) American Psychologist, 62 (9), pp. 993-1004; Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct (2010 amendments) (2010), http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx, Retrieved from; Anderson, N.D., Craik, F.I., 50 years of cognitive aging theory (2017) Journal of Gerontology: Series B, 72 (1), pp. 1-6; Appel, L., Appel, E., Bogler, O., Wiseman, M., Cohen, L., Ein, N., Campos, J.L., Older adults with cognitive and/or physical impairments can benefit from immersive virtual reality experiences: A feasibility study (2020) Frontiers of Medicine, 6, p. 329; Arafat, I.M., Ferdous, S.M.S., Quarles, J., March).

However, providing full spherical VR video with high quality under limited VR interaction latency is challenging. If the viewpoint of the VR user can be predicted in advance, only the required viewpoint is needed to be rendered and delivered, which can reduce the VR interaction latency. Therefore, in this paper, we use offline and online learning algorithms to predict viewpoint of the VR user using real VR dataset. For the offline learning algorithm, the trained learning model is directly used to predict the viewpoint of VR users in continuous time slots. While for the online learning algorithm, based on the VR user's actual viewpoint delivered through uplink transmission, we compare it with the predicted viewpoint and update the parameters and input viewpoints of the online learning algorithm to further improve the prediction accuracy. To guarantee the reliability of the uplink transmission, we integrate the Proactive retransmission scheme into our proposed online learning algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed online learning algorithm for uplink wireless VR network with the proactive retransmission scheme only exhibits about 5% prediction error. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",offline and online learning; uplink retransmission; Viewpoint prediction; virtual reality (VR),Continuous time systems; E-learning; Forecasting; Virtual reality; Continuous-time; Learning models; Online learning algorithms; Prediction accuracy; Prediction errors; Retransmission scheme; Retransmissions; Up-link transmissions; Learning algorithms,"Pearce, J., (2017) Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Device Sales to Hit 99 Million Devices in 2021, , http://www.capacitymedia.com/articles/3755961/VR-and-AR-device-shipments-to-hit-99m-by-2021, Oct; Merel, T., (2017) The Reality of VR/AR Growth, , Https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/11/the-reality-of-vrar-growth/, Jan; HTC Vive, , http://www.vive.com/, HTC; Oculus Rift, , http://www.oculus.com/, Facebook; Hu, F., Deng, Y., Saad, W., Bennis, M., Aghvami, A.H., Cellular-connected wireless virtual reality: Requirements, challenges, solu-tions (2020) IEEE Commun.

Evaluation of the effectiveness of VR among older populations revealed positive effects of VR as a tool to reduce risks of falls and also improve the social and emotional well-being of older adults. The decline in physical and mental health, the loss of functional capabilities, and a weakening of social ties represent obstacles towards active aging among older adults and indicate a need for support. Existing research focused on the effects of VR among older populations, and its uses and benefits. Our study investigated the acceptance and use of VR by the elderly. Methods: This pilot study was conducted on 30 older adults who voluntarily participated during March to May 2018. Nine VR applications that promote physical activities, motivate users, and provide entertainment were chosen for this study. Participants were asked to use any one of the applications of their choice for 15 min twice a week for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model and a literature review, to evaluate their acceptance of VR technology. Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis was used to test the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. Pearson's product moment correlation was used to examine the validity of the questionnaire. A linear regression and mediation analysis were utilized to identify relationships among the variables of the questionnaire. Results: In total, six male and 24 female participants aged 60~95 years volunteered to participate in the study. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social norms, and perceived enjoyment were seen to have had significant effects on the intention to use VR. Participants agreed to a large extent regarding the perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and their experience of using VR. Thus, VR was seen to have high acceptance among this elderly population. Conclusions: Older people have positive perceptions towards accepting and using VR to support active aging. They perceived VR to be useful, easy to use, and an enjoyable experience, implying positive attitudes toward adopting this new technology. © 2019 The Author(s).",Active aging; Older people; Technology acceptance model; Virtual reality,"adult; aged; article; clinical article; Cronbach alpha coefficient; female; healthy aging; human; human experiment; internal consistency; linear regression analysis; male; middle aged; perception; physical activity; pilot study; questionnaire; social norm; Taiwan; validity; virtual reality; aging; behavior; emotion; epidemiology; exercise; falling; patient attitude; physiology; prevention and control; psychology; reproducibility; Taiwan; very elderly; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Emotions; Exercise; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Virtual Reality","(2015) World Ageing Population, , United Nations DoEaSA, Population Division; (2016) Populations Projection for Republic of China: 2016-2060, , https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/cp.aspx?n=2E5DCB04C64512CC, Council ND; Harper, S., Economic and social implications of aging societies (2014) Science., 346 (6209), pp. 587-591. , 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhvVWlt7bE 25359967; Bloom, D.E., Chatterji, S., Kowal, P., Lloyd-Sherlock, P., McKee, M., Rechel, B., Macroeconomic implications of population ageing and selected policy responses (2015) Lancet., 385 (9968), pp. 649-657. , 25468167; Fernandez-Mayoralas, G., Rojo-Perez, F., Martinez-Martin, P., Prieto-Flores, M.E., Rodriguez-Blazquez, C., Martin-Garcia, S., Active ageing and quality of life: Factors associated with participation in leisure activities among institutionalized older adults, with and without dementia (2015) Aging Ment Health, 19 (11), pp. 1031-1041. , 25584744; Borg, C., Hallberg, I.R., Blomqvist, K., Life satisfaction among older people (65+) with reduced self-care capacity: The relationship to social, health and financial aspects (2006) J Clin Nurs, 15 (5), pp. 607-618. , 16629970; Blair, C.K., Robien, K., Inoue-Choi, M., Rahn, W., Lazovich, D., Physical inactivity and risk of poor quality of life among elderly cancer survivors compared to women without cancer: The Iowa Women's health study (2016) J Cancer Surviv, 10 (1), pp. 103-112. , 26008207; Vaz Fragoso, C.A., Miller, M.E., King, A.C., Kritchevsky, S.B., Liu, C.K., Myers, V.H., Effect of structured physical activity on sleep-wake behaviors in sedentary elderly adults with mobility limitations (2015) J Am Geriatr Soc, 63 (7), pp. 1381-1390. , 26115386 4892176; (2008) Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report Washington, , https://health.gov/paguidelines/2008/, Services USHaH, DC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

However, the performance metrics of emotion states provided by a low-cost EEG device suffer several reliability and accuracy issues, which can mislead the design decisions of the developers. In this research, we combined the EEG device with three virtual reality games to investigate the reliability of performance metrics extracted from the EEG data. We conducted the experiment with 14 players using virtual reality games with ranging levels of in-game actions. Our analysis shows that there is a significant difference between performance metrics provided by the EEG device and the actual players' experience. Finally, we used ad-hoc linear models to estimate the level of players' emotion states directly from the raw EEG. We also show the different brain activity maps for individual emotions, which reveal the commonly known relation between brain activity and specific emotions. © 2021 IEEE.",brain activity map; EEG; player emotions; virtual reality,Brain; Computer games; Costs; Electroencephalography; Human computer interaction; Neurophysiology; Brain activity; Brain activity map; Comparative evaluations; Game system; Low-costs; Performance metrices; Player emotion; Software-systems; Video software; Video-games; Virtual reality,"(2021) Is Vr Gaming Making You Sick Use These 5 Tips to Keep Playing, , https://www.dramamine.com/blog/vr-gaming-makingyou-sick-use-these-5-tips-to-keep-playing; Chang, R., Wu, C., He, K., Lin, B., A flexible and wearable EEG device (2016) 2016 Third International Conference on Computing Measurement Control and Sensor Network (CMCSN), pp. 48-51; (2021) What is An EEG Machine Definition & Faqs, , https://www.emotiv.com/glossary/EEG-machine/; (2021) EEG Headset Prices-an Overview of 15+ EEG Devices-imotions, , https://imotions.com/blog/EEG-headset-prices/, Imotions Publish; Pathirana, S., Asirvatham, D., Johar, G., A critical evaluation on low-cost consumer-grade electroencephalographic devices (2018) 2018 2nd International Conference on BioSignal Analysis, Processing and Systems (ICBAPS), pp. 160-165; Larocco, J., Le, M., Paeng, D.-G., A systemic review of available low-cost EEG headsets used for drowsiness detection (2020) Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 14, p. 10; Kosínski, J., Szklanny, K., Wieczorkowska, A., Wichrowski, M., An analysis of game-related emotions using emotiv epoc (2018) 2018 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS), pp. 913-917; Malete, T.N., Moruti, K., Thapelo, T.S., Jamisola, R.S., Eegbased control of a 3d game using 14-channel emotiv epoc+ (2019) 2019 IEEE International Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems (CIS) and IEEE Conference on Robotics, Automation and Mechatronics (RAM), pp. 463-468; Schalk, G., Mcfarland, D., Hinterberger, T., Birbaumer, N., Wolpaw, J., Bci2000: A general-purpose brain-computer interface (bci) system (2004) IEEE Trans.

A head-related transfer function (HRTF) ranking method is outlined for users of real-time, interactive sound and music applications. Twenty participants tested the approach and its impact on their capacity to locate a continuous musical sound rendered in varying 3D positions. Analysis of HRTF rankings across three separate sessions reveal encouraging levels of reliability amongst some participants. Patterns of interaction show a significant benefit to horizontal precision that results from the selection process. In contrast, length of system exposure (rather than HRTF preference) demonstrates a significant degree of improvement to aspects of vertical perception and overall speed of response, with no detriment to horizontal accuracy. These findings provide an initial basis from which to consider priorities in the design of audio-only immersive applications and accompanying methods for effective user controlled personalisation.

Often, this research involves the recording of physiological measures such as heart rate recordings with an electrocardiogram (ECG). One challenge is to enable remote, reliable and unobtrusive VR and heart rate data collection which would allow a wider application of VR research and practice in the field in future. To address the challenge, this work assessed the viability of replacing standard ECG devices with a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor that is directly integrated into a VR headset over the branches of the supratrochlear vessels. The objective of this study was to investigate the reliability of the PPG sensor for heart-rate detection. A total of 21 participants were recruited. They were asked to wear an ECG belt as ground truth and a VR headset with the embedded PPG sensor. Signals from both sensors were captured in free standing and sitting positions. Results showed that VR headset with an integrated PPG sensor is a viable alternative to an ECG for heart rate measurements in optimal conditions with limited movement. Future research will extend on this finding by testing it in more interactive VR settings. © 2020 ACM.",Affective neuroscience; ECG; Heart rate; PPG; Virtual reality,Electrocardiography; Heart; Interactive computer systems;

Virtual reality (VR) provides a strategy to design scenarios based on specific clinical occurrences to observe physicians’ competencies, aiding in the development of direct observation assessment instruments. This study was conducted at a large, urban pediatric primary care center. A VR curriculum was created to train pediatric residents on evidence-based BHAG competencies and motivational interviewing (MI) skills. The curriculum included three VR simulations, of increasing complexity, focused on caregiver concerns about tantrums. Residents verbally counseled graphical caregiver representatives (avatars) whose verbal and non-verbal responses were driven by a facilitator in real-time. We used Kane’s model to establish validity evidence for a direct observation instrument that included an assessment of interrater reliability by pediatric psychologists. A total of 42 VR observations were performed in 14 unique final year pediatric residents in May 2020. Interrater reliability was strong (kappa = 0.94). Resident’s scores on the instrument improved with progression through the curriculum that included deliberate practice with feedback. A range of scores were observed in each scenario. VR may provide an innovative approach to collecting validity evidence on a direct observation assessment instrument when opportunities for clinical observations are limited or when a competency is complex. VR’s ability to standardize simulated encounters for learners provides advantages to instrument development. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Behavioral health; Behavioral health anticipatory guidance; Medical education; Pediatric medical education; Virtual patients; Virtual reality; Virtual simulation,,"(2020) Entrustable Professional Activities, , https://www.abp.org/entrustable-professional-activities-epas, Retrieved October 9, from; Andrade, A.D., Bagri, A., Zaw, K., Roos, B.A., Ruiz, J.G., Avatar-mediated training in the delivery of bad news in a virtual world (2010) Journal of Palliative Medicine, 13 (12), pp. 1415-1419. , &, (,).,., (,)., https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2010.0108; Bauer, M.S., Damschroder, L., Hagedorn, H., Smith, J., Kilbourne, A.M., An introduction to implementation science for the non-specialist (2015) BMC Psychology, 3 (1). , &, (,).,., (,),., https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-015-0089-9; Boat, T.F., Land, M.L., Jr., Leslie, L.K., Health care workforce development to enhance mental and behavioral health of children and youths (2017) JAMA Pediatrics, 171 (11), pp. 1031-1032. , &, (,).,., (,)., https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.2473; Burdick, W.P., Schoffstall, J., Observation of emergency medicine residents at the bedside: how often does it happen?

The majority of vehicle operating activities are organized in the format of time series data. Many conventional approaches are proposed to deal with time-series data. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) approach is one of the most widely used methods to analyze time-series data. In this paper, an ARIMA-based anomaly detection framework is developed to identify abnormal states of the vehicles based on the multiple-channel operating time series data. The state anomaly is captured by the deviation of real-time values at different channels from the predictions. After abnormal operating states are identified, a novel immersive Virtual Reality (VR) tool is applied to visualize the difference between normal and abnormal status. The combination of ARIMA anomaly detection and VR visualization for vehicle multiple-channel operating time-series data would provide a robust way to present the results of vehicle operating status. A large scale data set of 14 days operational performance channels of a specific vehicle is utilized to validate the performance of the proposed approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Autoregressive integrated moving average approach; Data visualization; Immersive virtual reality; Multi-channel time series data,Anomaly detection; Data visualization; Time series; Vehicle performance; Visualization; Anomaly detection; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average approach; Immersive virtual reality; Moving averages; Multi-channel time series data; Multiple channels; Operating state; Operating time; Time-series data; Virtual reality,"Aggarwal, C.C., (2017), An introduction to outlier analysis.

This paper introduces and evaluates a system for power substation operational training by exploring and interacting with realistic models in virtual worlds using serious games. The virtual reality (VR) simulator used building information modelling (BIM) from a 115 kV substation to develop a scenario with high technical detail suitable for professional training. This system created interactive models that could be explored using a first-person-perspective serious game in a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). Different operational missions could be carried out in the serious game, allowing several skills to be coached. The suitability for vocational training carried out by utility companies was evaluated in terms of usability and engagement. The evaluation used a System Usability Scale (SUS) and a Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ) filled by 16 power substation operators demonstrating marginally acceptable usability, with improvement opportunities and high acceptance (by utility technicians) of this system for operation training focused on safety in such hazardous tasks. © 2022 by the authors.

Nowadays, the solution adopted is mainly based on remote operated vehicle (ROV) technology. These ROVs are controlled from support vessels by using unnecessarily complex human–robot interfaces (HRI). Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of these systems to make them easier to use and to reduce the stress on the operator. In this paper, and as part of the TWIN roBOTs for the cooperative underwater intervention missions (TWINBOT) project, we present an HRI (Human-Robot Interface) module which includes virtual reality (VR) technology. In fact, this contribution is an improvement on a preliminary study in this field also carried out, by our laboratory. Hence, having made a concerted effort to improve usability, the HRI system designed for robot control tasks presented in this paper is substantially easier to use. In summary, reliability and feasibility of this HRI module have been demonstrated thanks to the usability tests, which include a very complete pilot study, and guarantee much more friendly and intuitive properties in the final HRI-developed module presented here. © 2020 by the authors.

Accordingly, adaptive human-aware environments, sensitive to the daily human behavior and individual traits have to be provided, in order to offer a fully immersive and customized experience to users. On the basis of data collected by actual cognitive experiments, this paper proposes a learning framework to discover the multi-sensory human perceptual experience. The paper applies the mixture density network to identify the perception model considering different senses, and then the multi-sensory integration is performed, accordingly to the actual neuro-cognitive model. Furthermore, a supervised learning module has been used to cluster the users on the basis of the human perception identification strategy previously designed, assuming a multimodal structure for the cognitive brain activity. Finally, a practical contextualization is presented, in relation to the haptics virtual reality services. What emerges from the results is the effectiveness of the tactful approach, i.e., brain-aware, involving the proposed framework, which is validated in comparison to the more conventional brain-agnostic scheme. In fact, the system performance, expressed in terms of reliability in guaranteeing the service exploitation before a target deadline based on the integrated perception, reaches remarkable improvements applying the brain-aware strategy, which exploits the human perception knowledge. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This trend is expected to continue in future, with the advent of high-performance gaming and increasing appetite for immersive applications and social media experiences. Such factors have contributed to the development of the fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks, which would be supporting significantly higher data rates with improved reliability and latency. 5G has also enabled the deployment of wireless virtual reality applications, with wide-ranging use cases. In this work, we consider the key challenges for broadcasting such content to a large number of audience thereby enabling new disruptions in mass media consumption. The technology potential and practical constraints for such deployments were also evaluated using realistic network settings. Based on the performance evaluations, it was shown that with slightly higher system bandwidth requirements, VR broadcast can be supported under ideal conditions, using 5G millimeter wave small cell networks. Potential areas for future work in order to make VR broadcast a reality is also discussed. © 2018 IEEE.",,Millimeter waves; Virtual reality; Wireless telecommunication systems; Exponential increase; Fifth generation (5g); Immersive application; Network operator; Network settings; Performance evaluations; Small cell Networks; System bandwidth; 5G mobile communication systems,"Osseiran, A., Boccardi, F., Braun, V., Scenarios for 5g mobile and wireless communications: The vision of the metis project (2014) IEEE Communications Magazine, 52 (5), pp. 26-35; (2017) Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Methodology, 2016-2021, , Cisco June; Lien, S.-Y., Shieh, S.-L., Huang, Y., Su, B., Hsu, Y.-L., Wei, H.-Y., 5G New radio: Waveform, frame structure, multiple access, and initial access (2017) IEEE Communications Magazine, 55 (6), pp. 64-71; Iwamura, M., NGMN View on 5G Architecture (2015) IEEE 81st Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring), pp. 1-5; (2015) 5G White Paper, , NGMN Alliance Feb; Matinmikko, M., Latva-Aho, M., Ahokangas, P., Yrjölä, S., Koivumäki, T., Micro Operators to boost local service delivery in 5g (2017) Wireless Personal Communications, pp. 1-14; Abari, O., Bharadia, D., Duffield, A., Katabi, D., Cutting the cord in virtual reality (2016) Proceedings of the 15th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks.

To date, no VR dental simulator exercise has been designed which is capable of reliably providing validated, meaningful clinical feedback to dental students. This study aims to measure the concurrent validity of the assessment and the provision of qualitative feedback, pertaining to cavity preparations by VR dental simulators. Methods: A cavity preparation exercise was created on a VR dental simulator, and assessment criteria for cavity preparations were developed. The exercise was performed 10 times in order to demonstrate a range of performances, and for each, the simulator feedback was recorded. The exercises were subsequently three-dimensionally printed, and 12 clinical teachers were asked to assess the preparations according to the same criteria. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) between clinical teachers was measured using a free-marginal multirater kappa value. Clinical teacher assessment responses were compared with the VR simulator responses and percentage agreements calculated. Results: IRR values for each exercise ranged from 0.39 to 0.77 (69.39%-88.48%). The assessment of smoothness (κfree 0.58, 78.79%) and ability to follow the outline (κfree 0.56, 77.88%) demonstrated highest agreement between clinical teachers, whilst the assessment of undercut (κfree 0.15, 57.58%) and depth (κfree 0.28, 64.09%) had the lowest agreement. The modal percentage agreement between clinical teachers and the VR simulator was, on average, 78% across all exercises. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to provide reliable and clinically relevant qualitative feedback via a VR dental simulator. Further research should look to employ this technique across a broader range of exercises that help to develop other complex operative dental skills. © 2020 The Authors.

Meanwhile, instrumental posturography has been used widely to obtain quantitative data and characterize balance abilities and underlying control mechanisms, but not as often for sitting balance. Moreover, traditional kinetic methods using a force platform to test sitting stability often require modification and are costly. We proposed a tracker-based posturography with a commercial virtual reality system, the VIVE Pro system (HTC, Inc. Taiwan), to record the trunk displacement (TD) path with a lumbar tracker for evaluation of sitting stability. The goals were to test the reliability and validity of the TD parameters among stroke patients. Methods: Twenty-one stroke individuals and 21 healthy adults had their postural sway measured with this system under four sitting conditions, i.e., sitting on a solid surface or a soft surface, with eyes open or closed. The test–retest reliability of the TD parameters was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients in 22 participants. We also tested the discriminative validity of these parameters to discriminate between stroke and healthy controls, and among four sitting conditions. Furthermore, the TD parameters were correlated with the three balance function tests: the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS) and the Function in Sitting Test (FIST). Results: The results indicated that the TD parameters obtained by tracker-based posturography had mostly moderate to good reliability across the four conditions, with a few exceptions in the solid surface and eyes open tasks. The TD parameters could discriminate the postural stability between sitting on solid and soft surfaces. The stroke group had more seated postural sway than the control group, especially while sitting on a soft surface. In addition, velocity measures in the sagittal and frontal planes had moderate to high correlations with the PASS and BBS scores. Conclusions: This tracker-based system is a cost-effective option for the clinical assessment of body stability for stroke patients in a seated position and shows acceptable reliability and validity. © 2022, The Author(s).",Postural stability;

Treatment studies aimed at cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia not only require demonstration of improvements on cognitive tests, but also evidence that any cognitive changes lead to clinically meaningful improvements. Measures of ""functional capacity"" index the extent to which individuals have the potential to perform skills required for real world functioning. Current data do not support the recommendation of any single instrument for measurement of functional capacity. The Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT) is a novel, interactive gaming based measure of functional capacity that uses a realistic simulated environment to recreate routine activities of daily living. Studies are currently underway to evaluate and establish the VRFCAT's sensitivity, reliability, validity, and practicality. This new measure of functional capacity is practical, relevant, easy to use, and has several features that improve validity and sensitivity of measurement of function in clinical trials of patients with CNS disorders.",Aging; Behavior; Cognitive assessment; Computer based assessment; Dementia; Functional capacity; Issue 86; Neuropsychology; Schizophrenia; Virtual reality,,"Murray, C.J., Lopez, A.D., Evidence-based health policy-Lessons from the global burden of disease study (1996) Science, 274, pp. 740-743. , doi:10.1126/science.274.5288.740; Wu, E.Q., The economic burden of schizophrenia in the United States in 2002 (2005) J Clin Psychiatry, 66 (9), pp. 1122-1129; Saykin, A.J., Neuropsychological deficits in neuroleptic naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia (1994) Arch Gen Psychiatry, 51 (2), pp. 124-131. , doi:10.1001/archpsyc.1994.03950020048005; Fuller, R., Nopoulos, P., Arndt, S., O'Leary, D., Ho, B.C., Andreasen, N.C., Longitudinal assessment of premorbid cognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia through examination of standardized scholastic test performance (2002) Am J Psychiatry, 159 (7), pp. 1183-1189. , doi:10.1176/appi/ajp.159.7.1183; Hawkins, K.A., Neuropsychological status of subjects at high risk for a first episode of psychosis (2004) Schizophr Res, 67 (2-3), pp. 115-122. , doi:10.1016/j.schres.2003.08.007; Green, M.F., Braff, D.L., Translating the basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience of schizophrenia to drug development and clinical trials of antipsychotic medications (2001) Biol Psychiatry, 49 (4), pp. 374-384; Heinrichs, R.W., Zakzanis, K.K., Neurocognitive deficit in schizophrenia: A quantitative review of the evidence (1998) Neuropsychology, 12 (3), pp. 426-445. , doi:10.1037/0894-4105.12.3.426; Bilder, R.M., Neuropsychology of first-episode schizophrenia: Initial characterization and clinical correlates (2000) Am J Psychiatry, 157 (4), pp. 549-559; Green, M.F., What are the functional consequences of neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia?

Implicit behavior from users, such as hand or gaze movements, might provide additional signals to improve the reliability of input. In this paper, the primary goal is to improve the detection of a selection gesture in VR during point-and-click interaction. Thus, we propose and investigate the use of information contained within the hand motion dynamics that precede a selection gesture. We built two models that classified if a user is likely to perform a selection gesture at the current moment in time. We collected data during a pointing-and-selection task from 15 participants and trained two models with different architectures, i.e., a logistic regression classifier was trained using predefined hand motion features and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) classifier was trained using raw hand motion data. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation PR-AUCs of 0.36 and 0.90 were obtained for each model respectively, demonstrating that the models performed well above chance (=0.13). The TCN model was found to improve the precision of a noisy selection gesture by 11.2% without sacrificing recall performance. An initial analysis of the generalizability of the models demonstrated above-chance performance, suggesting that this approach could be scaled to other interaction tasks in the future. © 2022 ACM.",gesture detection;

The technology and development tools are based on SteamVR Tracking technology by Valve Corporation. The head tracker involves an integrated electric circuit board and a rigid frame with photodiode sensors attached to a pair of 3D shutter glasses. One or two lighthouse base station(s) achieve the tracking by sending out infrared signals to time-stamp movement. The development process involves iterations of sensor placement simulation, 3D printing of prototype, optical and sensor calibration, and reliability testing. The current prototype can be used in imseCAVE, a CAVE-based system in HKU and has the potential for other applications such as for education or businesses usage. © 2017 IEEE.",imseCAVE; infrared sensors; Low-cost tracking; motion tracking; SteamVR tracking,Costs; Infrared detectors; Lighthouses; Tracking (position); Virtual reality; Electric circuit boards; Head tracking system; imseCAVE; Infra-red sensor; Low costs; Motion tracking; Research and development; Virtual reality system; 3D printers,"VESA Standard Connector and Signal Standards for Stereoscopic Display Hardware.

However, the preparation and operation of full-fledged simulators and trainers is very expensive and, therefore, virtual environment tools are used. A question that has not yet been answered is: Can virtual reality match the reliability of other methods of operation and is the same training in virtual reality effective? The experiment was carried out in the three-walled virtual CAVE, with virtual reality glasses, with a computer, a tablet, and a real control panel. Visual stimuli were displayed on the screen of the virtual monitor (green, yellow, and red); auditory stimuli were pure tones with frequencies of 250, 1000 and 4000 Hz. The conclusion should explicitly state if the hypothesis defined for the research has been confirmed and there are significant differences in terms of interface type. Training in virtual reality induces lower operator reliability, but in specific conditions (visual stimuli, virtual reality glasses) can match the reliability of other methods of operation and can be effective. © 2022, MM publishing Ltd.

During the process of using HMD, there is a certain time gap between the user's movement and the triggered change of display, which is referred to herein as a ' Motion-To-Photon ' latency. The latency may cause cybersickness which has an adverse effect on user experience and even physical health, so it is necessary to evaluate the latency of an HMD. We propose an automated and universal HMD latency measurement system. By simulating a user's motion, we are able to measure 'Motion-To-Photon' latency using the generated periodic signals in HMD, with accuracy and reliability confirmed by our experiments. The system is fully automatic and easy to use, and suitable for the HMD with inside-out or outside-in positioning methods. It helps to improve both the detection level of existing HMDs and the user experience. It is of guiding significance for the design and manufacture of new HMD. © 2019 IEEE.",Head-mounted-display; Measurement; Motion-To-photon-latency; Virtual-reality,Augmented reality; Measurement; Photons; Virtual reality; Design and manufactures; Detection levels; Guiding significances; Head mounted displays; Latency measurements; Motion-To-photon-latency; Physical health; Positioning methods; Helmet mounted displays,"Davies, S., Virtually there (2009) Engineering & Technology, 4, p. 68; Cruz-Neira, C., Sandin, D.J., Defanti, T.A., Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality: The design and implementation of the CAVE (1993) Proceedings of the 20th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, pp. 135-142. , ACM, September; La, V., Jr., A discussion of cybersickness in virtual environments (2000) ACM SIGCHI Bulletin, 1, pp. 47-56. , January; Papadakis, G., Mania, K., Koutroulis, E., A system to measure, control and minimize end-To-end head tracking latency in immersive simulations Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on VIrtual Reality, pp. 581-584. , Continuum and Its Applications in Industry.

Both the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) require drone operators to keep the drone in sight and avoid flying near people or other objects. From the perspective of the operator, remaining in standing or sitting position while always looking up to monitor the drone movements can cause awkward body postures, stress, and fatigue. Coupled with the mental load resulting from delegated tasks, this could potentially put the drone mission, people, and property at risk. This research investigates the reliability of using the drone operator's physiological indexes and self-assessments to predict performance, mental workload (MWL), and stress in immersive virtual reality training and outdoor deployment. A user study was carried out to collect physiological data using wearable devices and design general population and group-specific prediction models. Results show that in 83% of cases, these models can predict performance, MWL, and stress levels accurately or within one level. This paper contributes to the core body of knowledge by providing a scalable approach to objectively quantifying performance, MWL, and stress that can be used to design adaptive training systems for drone operators. Personalized models of physiological signals are presented as reliable indexes to describing the outcome of interest. Scalability is achieved through the application of generalizable machine learning models that learn the interdependencies between physiological and self-assessment inputs and their association with corresponding outcomes. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Human performance; Machine learning (ML); Mental workload; Physiological signals; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); Virtual reality (VR); Wearable technology,Adaptive systems; Antennas; Automobile bodies; Data acquisition; Drones; E-learning; Forecasting; Personnel training; Physiology; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Safety engineering; Virtual reality; Adaptive training system; General population; Immersive virtual reality; Machine learning models; Personalized model; Physiological indices; Physiological signals; Us federal aviation administrations; Physiological models,"Acharya, R., Kannathal, N., Krishnan, S.M., Comprehensive analysis of cardiac health using heart rate signals (2004) Physiol.

With increasing needs for neurorehabilitation advances, new technology based methods, such as virtual reality (VR) have emerged. Here, we developed an immersive VR version of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT-VR) to complement neurorehabilitation. Objective: This study aimed to assess the validity, usability and test–retest reliability of the ARAT-VR among individuals with stroke, healthcare professionals and healthy control subjects (HCS). Methods: Among the 19 items of the ARAT, 13 items were selected and developed in immersive VR. 11 healthcare professionals, 30 individuals with stroke, and 25 HCS were recruited. Content validity was assessed by asking healthcare professionals to rate the difficulty of performing each item of the ARAT-VR in comparison to the classical Action Research Arm Test (ARAT-19). Concurrent validity was first measured using correlation (Spearman tests) between the ARAT-VR and ARAT-19 scores for the individuals with stroke, and second through correlation and comparison between the scores of the ARAT-VR and the reduced version of the ARAT (ARAT-13) for both individuals with stroke and HCS (Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Bland–Altman plots). Usability was measured using the System Usability Scale. A part of individuals with stroke and HCS were re-tested following a convenient delay to measure test–retest reliability (Intra-class correlation and Wilcoxon tests). Results: Regarding the content validity, median difficulty of the 13 ARAT-VR items (0[0 to − 1] to 0[0–1]) evaluated by healthcare professionals was rated as equivalent to the classical ARAT for all tasks except those involving the marbles. For these, the difficulty was rated as superior to the real tasks (1[0–1] when pinching with the thumb-index and thumb-middle fingers, and 1[0–2] when pinching with thumb-ring finger). Regarding the concurrent validity, for paretic hand scores, there were strong correlations between the ARAT-VR and ARAT-13 (r = 0.84), and between the ARAT-VR and ARAT-19 (r = 0.83). Usability (SUS = 82.5[75–90]) and test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.99; p < 0.001) were excellent. Conclusion: The ARAT-VR is a valid, usable and reliable tool that can be used to assess upper limb activity among individuals with stroke, providing potential to increase assessment frequency, remote evaluation, and improve neurorehabilitation.

Therefore, the Virtual Peg Insertion Test (VPIT), an assessment combining virtual reality and haptic feedback during a goal-oriented task derived from the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), was developed. This study aimed to evaluate (1) the concurrent validity of key outcome measures of the VPIT, namely the execution time and the number of dropped pegs, with the NHPT and Box and Block Test (BBT), and (2) the test-retest-reliability of these parameters together with the VPIT's additional kinetic and kinematic parameters in patients with chronic stroke. The three tests were administered on 31 chronic patients with stroke in one session (concurrent validity), and the VPIT was retested in a second session 3-7 days later (test-retest reliability). Spearman rank correlation coefficients (ρ) were calculated for assessing concurrent validity, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine relative reliability. Bland-Altman plots were drawn and the smallest detectable difference (SDD) was calculated to examine absolute reliability. Results: For the 31 included patients, 11 were able to perform the VPIT solely via use of their affected arm, whereas 20 patients also had to utilize support from their unaffected arm. For n = 31, the VPIT showed low correlations with the NHPT (ρ = 0.31 for time (Tex[s]); ρ = 0.21 for number of dropped pegs (Ndp)) and BBT (ρ = -0.23 for number of transported cubes (Ntc); ρ = -0.12 for number of dropped cubes (Ndc)). The test-retest reliability for the parameters Tex[s], mean grasping force (Fggo[N]), number of zero-crossings (Nzc[1/sgo/return) and mean collision force (Fcmean[N]) were good to high, with ICCs ranging from 0.83 to 0.94. Fair reliability could be found for Fgreturn (ICC = 0.75) and trajectory error (Etrajgo[cm]) (0.70). Poor reliability was measured for Etrajreturn[cm] (0.67) and Ndp (0.58). The SDDs were: Tex = 70.2 s, Ndp = 0.4 pegs; Fggo/return = 3.5/1.2 Newton; Nzc[1/s]go/return = 0.2/1.8 zero-crossings; Etrajgo/return = 0.5/0.8 cm; Fcmean = 0.7 Newton. Conclusions: The VPIT is a promising upper limb function assessment for patients with stroke requiring other components of upper limb motor performance than the NHPT and BBT. The high intra-subject variation indicated that it is a demanding test for this stroke sample, which necessitates a thorough introduction to this assessment. Once familiar, the VPIT provides more objective and comprehensive measurements of upper limb function than conventional, non-computerized hand assessments. © 2016 Tobler-Ammann et al.",Concurrent validity; Stroke; Test-retest reliability; Upper limb function; Virtual Peg Insertion Test,adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; concurrent validity; controlled study; female; functional assessment; grip strength; hand function; human; kinematics; male; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rehabilitation care; tactile feedback; task performance; test retest reliability; Virtual Peg Insertion Test; virtual reality; aged; biomechanics; cerebrovascular accident; chronic disease; computer interface; middle aged; occupational therapy; pathophysiology; physiotherapy; procedures; psychomotor performance; reproducibility; stroke rehabilitation; treatment outcome; upper limb; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Chronic Disease; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Therapy; Physical Therapy Modalities; Psychomotor Performance; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Treatment Outcome; Upper Extremity; User-Computer Interface,"Lundborg, G., (2014) The Hand and the Brain. from Lucy's Thumb to the Tought-controlled Robotic Hand, , Springer London; Johansson, B.B., Current trends in stroke rehabilitation.

Woodruff Ave, Columbus, OH  43210, United States","Stereoscopic virtual reality (VR) has experienced a resurgence due to flagship products such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and smartphone-based VR solutions like Google Cardboard. This is causing the question to resurface: how can stereoscopic VR be useful in instruction, if at all, and what are the pedagogical best practices for its use? To address this, and to continue our work in this sphere, we performed a study of 289 introductory physics students who were sorted into three different treatment types: stereoscopic virtual reality, WebGL simulation, and static 2D images, each designed to provide information about magnetic fields and forces. Students were assessed using preliminary items designed to focus on heavily-3D systems. We report on assessment reliability, and on student performance. Overall, we find that students who used VR did not significantly outperform students using other treatment types. There were significant differences between sexes, as other studies have noted. Dependence on students’ self-reported 3D videogame play was observed, in keeping with previous studies, but this dependence was not restricted to the VR treatment. © 2019, American Association of Physics Teachers.

However, a critical appraisal of the reliability of visual rating scales in neurosurgery is lacking. Therefore, we sought to design a study to compare visual rating scales with simulated metrics in a neurosurgical virtual reality task. Methods: Neurosurgical faculty rated anonymized participant video recordings of the removal of simulated brain tumors using a visual rating scale made up of seven composite elements. Scale reliability was evaluated using generalizability theory, and scale subcomponents were compared with simulated metrics using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Four staff neurosurgeons evaluated 16 medical student neurosurgery applicants. Overall scale reliability and internal consistency were 0.73 and 0.90, respectively. Reliability of 0.71 was achieved with two raters. Individual participants, raters, and scale items accounted for 27%, 11%, and 0.6% of the data variability. The hemostasis scale component related to the greatest number of simulated metrics, whereas respect for no-go zones and tissue was correlated with none. Metrics relating to instrument force and patient safety (brain volume removed and blood loss) were captured by the fewest number of rating scale components. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing participant's ratings with simulated performance. Given rating scales capture less well instrument force, quantity of brain volume removed, and blood loss, we suggest adopting a hybrid educational approach using visual rating scales in an operative environment, supplemented by simulated sessions to uncover potentially problematic surgical technique. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Assessment; Education; Neurosurgery; Resident; Simulation; Surgery,"Article; brain tumor; Canadian; comparative study; controlled study; human; internal consistency; medical student; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; rating scale; simulated virtual reality metrics; stereoscopic vision; surgical training; videorecording; virtual reality; visual rating scale; Young modulus; brain tumor; education; medical education; neurosurgery; observer variation; operative blood loss; patient safety; procedures; psychomotor performance; simulation training; theoretical model; Blood Loss, Surgical; Brain Neoplasms; Educational Measurement; Humans; Internship and Residency; Models, Theoretical; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Observer Variation; Patient Safety; Psychomotor Performance; Simulation Training; Students, Medical; Video Recording; Virtual Reality","Jensen, R.L., Alzhrani, G., Kestle, J.R.W., Brockmeyer, D.L., Lamb, S.M., Couldwell, W.T., Neurosurgeon as educator: a review of principles of adult education and assessment applied to neurosurgery (2017) J Neurosurg, 127, pp. 949-957; Aldave, G., Hansen, D., Briceno, V., Luerssen, T.G., Jea, A., Assessing residents' operative skills for external ventricular drain placement and shunt surgery in pediatric neurosurgery (2017) J Neurosurg Pediatr, 19, pp. 377-383; Hadley, C., Lam, S.K., Briceño, V., Luerssen, T.G., Jea, A., Use of a formal assessment instrument for evaluation of resident operative skills in pediatric neurosurgery (2015) J Neurosurg Pediatr, 16, pp. 497-504; Sarkiss, C.A., Philemond, S., Lee, J., Neurosurgical skills assessment: measuring technical proficiency in neurosurgery residents through intraoperative video evaluations (2016) World Neurosurg, 89, pp. 1-8; Bajunaid, K., Mullah, M.A., Winkler-Schwartz, A., Impact of acute stress on psychomotor bimanual performance during a simulated tumor resection task (2016) J Neurosurg, 126, pp. 71-80; Alotaibi, F.E., AlZhrani, G.A., Mullah, M.A.S., Assessing bimanual performance in brain tumor resection with NeuroTouch, a virtual reality simulator (2015) Oper Neurosurg, 11, pp. 89-98; Gelinas-Phaneuf, N., Choudhury, N., Al-Habib, A.R., Assessing performance in brain tumor resection using a novel virtual reality simulator (2014) Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg, 9, pp. 1-9; Winkler-Schwartz, A., Bajunaid, K., Mullah, M.A., Bimanual psychomotor performance in neurosurgical resident applicants assessed using NeuroTouch, a virtual reality simulator (2016) J Surg Educ, 73, pp. 942-953; Alotaibi, F.E., AlZhrani, G.A., Sabbagh, A.J., Azarnoush, H., Winkler-Schwartz, A., Del Maestro, R.F., Neurosurgical assessment of metrics including judgment and dexterity using the virtual reality simulator NeuroTouch (NAJD Metrics) (2015) Surg Innov, 22, pp. 636-642; AlZhrani, G., Alotaibi, F., Azarnoush, H., Proficiency performance benchmarks for removal of simulated brain tumors using a virtual reality simulator NeuroTouch (2015) J Surg Educ, 72, pp. 685-696; Sugiyama, T., Lama, S., Gan, L., Maddahi, Y., Zareinia, K., Sutherland, G.R., Forces of tool-tissue interaction to assess surgical skill level (2018) JAMA Surg, 153, pp. 234-242; Azarnoush, H., Alzhrani, G., Winkler-Schwartz, A., Neurosurgical virtual reality simulation metrics to assess psychomotor skills during brain tumor resection (2015) Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg, 10, pp. 603-618; Aggarwal, R., Grantcharov, T., Moorthy, K., Milland, T., Darzi, A., Toward feasible, valid, and reliable video-based assessments of technical surgical skills in the operating room (2008) Ann Surg, 247, pp. 372-379; Sawaya, R., Alsideiri, G., Bugdadi, A., Development of a performance model for virtual reality tumor resections (2018) J Neurosurg, 1, pp. 1-9; Streiner, D.L., Norman, G.R., Cairney, J., Health Measurement Scales: A Practical Guide to Their Development and Use (2015), Oxford University Press Oxford, England, UK; Feldman, M., Lazzara, E.H., Vanderbilt, A.A., DiazGranados, D., Rater training to support high-stakes simulation-based assessments (2012) J Contin Educ Health Prof, 32, pp. 279-286; Sawaya, R., Bugdadi, A., Azarnoush, H., Virtual reality tumor resection: the force pyramid approach (2017) Oper Neurosurg, 14, pp. 686-696; Azarnoush, H., Siar, S., Sawaya, R., The force pyramid: a spatial analysis of force application during virtual reality brain tumor resection (2017) J Neurosurg, 127, pp. 171-181; Pang, P., Raslan, A.M., Selden, N.R., Improving performance by improving education (2018) Quality and Safety in Neurosurgery, pp. 213-224. , D.J.

However, the effect of age on more specific navigational components such as the ability to drive or update directional information has not received enough attention. In this study we investigated the effect of age on spatial updating of a visual target after a series of whole–body rotations and transitions using a novel landmark-less virtual reality (VR) environment. Moreover, a significant number of previous studies focused on measures susceptible to a general decline in motor skills such as the spent time navigating, the distance traversed. The current paper proposes a new compound spatial measure to assess navigational performance, examines its reliability and compares its power with those of the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting participants' age and cognitive groups assessed by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores. Using data from 319 adults (20–83 years), our results confirm the reliability, the age sensitivity, and the cognitive validity of the designed spatial measure as well as its superiority to the measures of duration and traversed distance in predicting age and MoCA score. In addition, the results show the significant effect of age cognitive status on spatial updating. © 2016 The Experimental Psychology Society.",Ageing; Measurement; Spatial cognition; Spatial orientation; Virtual reality navigation,"adult; aged; aging; analysis of variance; cognition; computer interface; depth perception; female; human; male; middle aged; neuropsychological test; orientation; physiology; psychology; regression analysis; reproducibility; spatial orientation; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Analysis of Variance; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Orientation; Orientation, Spatial; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Space Perception; Spatial Navigation; User-Computer Interface; Young Adult","Aguirre, G., D’Esposito, M., Topographical disorientation: A synthesis and taxonomy (1999) Brain: A Journal of Neurology, 122, pp. 1613-1628; Antanova, E., Parslow, D., Brammer, M., Dawson, G., Jackson, S., Morris, R., Age-related neural activity during allocentric spatial memory (2009) Memory, 17 (2), pp. 125-143; Arnold, A., Burles, F., Krivoruchko, T., Liu, I., Rey, C., Levy, R., Iaria, G., Cognitive mapping in humans and its relationship to other orientation skills (2013) Experimental Brain Research, 224, pp. 359-372; Banta Lavenex, P., Lecci, S., Prêtre, V., Brandner, C., Mazza, C., Pasquier, J., Lavenex, P., As the world turns: Short-term human spatial memory in egocentric and allocentric coordinates (2011) Behavioural Brain Research, 219 (1), pp. 132-141; Barrash, J., Age-related decline in route learning ability (1994) Developmental Neuropsychology, 10, pp. 189-201; Baumann, O., Chan, E., Mattingley, J.B., Distinct neural networks underlie encoding of categorical versus coordinate spatial relations during active navigation (2012) NeuroImage, 60 (3), pp. 1630-1637; Byagowi, A., Mohaddes, D., Moussavi, Z., Design and application of a novel Virtual Reality navigational Technology (VRNChair) (2014) Journal of Experimental Neuroscience, 8, pp. 7-14; Byagowi, A., Moussavi, Z., (2012), August, Design of a Virtual Reality navigational experiment for assessment of egocentric spatial cognition.

Such systems generally combine several hardware components operating at different time scales, and software that has to cope with these timing constraints. MIRELA, for Mixed Reality Language, is a framework aimed at modelling, analysing and implementing systems composed of sensors, processing units, shared memories and rendering loops, communicating in a well-defined manner and submitted to timing constraints. The paper describes how harmful software behaviour, which may result in possible hardware deterioration or revert the system's primary goal from user assistance to user impediment, may be detected such as (global and local) deadlocks or starvation features.

This paper describes safety and feasibility testing for an immersive virtual reality (VR) application designed to teach essential skills for interacting with law enforcement (Floreo Police Safety Module; PSM). First, we present evidence that using immersive VR in verbally able adolescents and adults with ASD is feasible. Of 28 participants, 100% were able to complete one session of Floreo PSM. Second, we show that Floreo PSM is safe; no severe adverse events occurred during or after study participation. Third, we report that Floreo PSM is highly usable. An industry-standard measure of usability – the System Usability Scale (SUS) – was carefully modified to meet the particular needs of our clinical sample, resulting in an improved SUS-ASD. The SUS-ASD demonstrates good internal reliability and broad range, with scores that are statistically independent of age, IQ, and autism symptomology. In Phase II of this government-funded research project, we will test the efficacy of Floreo PSM to improve targeted behaviors during a live police interaction, and will conduct a community-based randomized controlled trial that lays the groundwork for deploying Floreo PSM to schools, homes, clinics, prisons, and halfway houses. The long-term goals of this project are to improve safety outcomes for vulnerable civilians while reducing stress on law enforcement personnel. © 2018, Interactive Media Institute.

Such three ultra-high (3UH) requirements constitute the basic characteristics of the generalized tactile internet. This paper proposes a multiuser MAC scheduling scheme for VR service in 5G MIMO-OFDM system, which can maximize the number of simultaneous VR clients while guaranteeing their 3UH quality-of-experience (QoE). Specifically, this scheme is composed of three novel functions, including video frame differentiation and delay-based weight calculation, spatial-frequency user selection based on maximum aggregate delay-capacity utility (ADCU), and link adaptation with dynamic block-error-rate (BLER) target. In addition, a low-complexity downlink MIMO user selection algorithm is developed, which can reduce the calculation amount with one order. It is demonstrated by the simulation results that the proposed scheme increases 31.6% for the maximum number of simultaneously served VR users than the traditional scheme with maximum-sum-capacity based scheduling and fixed BLER target based link adaptation. © 2018 IEEE.",Deep Packet Inspection; Delay-Based; Link Adaptation; MAC Scheduling; MIMO-OFDM; Multiuser Wireless Virtual Reality,Gain control; MIMO systems; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Quality of service; Scheduling; Virtual reality; Deep packet inspection; Delay-Based; Link adaptation; MAC scheduling; MIMO-OFDM; Multi-user; 5G mobile communication systems,"Ge, X., Multipath Cooperative Communications Networks for Augmented and Virtual Reality Transmission (2017) IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 19 (10), pp. 2345-2358. , Oct; Hou, X., Wireless VR/AR with Edge/Cloud Computing (2017) ICCCN; Ahn, J., Delay oriented VR mode WLAN for efficient Wireless multi-user Virtual Reality device (2017) IEEE ICCE; Podkosova, I., Immersivedeck: A large-scale wireless VR system for multiple users (2016) IEEE Workshop on SEARIS; LaValle, S.M., Head tracking for the Oculus Rift (2014) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA); Hosseini, M., View-aware tile-based adaptations in 360 virtual reality video streaming (2017) IEEE Virtual Reality (VR), pp. 423-424; Maier, M., The tactile internet: Vision, recent progress, and open challenges (2016) IEEE Communications Magazine, 54 (5), pp. 138-145. , May; Lee, S.-H., Adaptation for the retransmission in VoIP applications (2017) Journal of Communications and Networks, 19 (3), pp. 298-305. , Mar; Huang, S., User selection for multiuser MIMO downlink with zero-forcing beamforming (2013) IEEE Trans. on Vehicular Technology, 62 (7), pp. 3084-3097. , Sep; Bogale, T.E., User Scheduling for Massive MIMO OFDMA Systems with Hybrid Analog-Digital Beamforming (2015) IEEE ICC; (2015) E-UTRAN Overall Description (Release 13), , 3GPP Technique Specification 36.300 v13.0.0 Jun; (2017) NR Physical-Layer Standards (Release 15), , 3GPP Technique Specification 38.211-214; Huang, M., Design of Low-Latency Uplink MAC Scheduling for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems (2017) IEEE ICC Workshop; Noble, B., Danniel, J.W., (1988) Applied Linear Algebra, , 3rd ed.

One way in which techniques could be taught to address these requirements is through immersive tutorials in virtual reality (VR), that employ a 3D video (filmed from the first-person point-of-view [FPV]), which is then displayed through an immersive VR application (IVRA-FPV). The present study assessed the pedagogical value of the IVRA-FPV training that taught participants how to implement a lumbar puncture. This procedure was recorded and the corresponding IVRA-FPV tutorial was produced. Medical users/learners (N = 89) were subjected to a prospective randomized comparative study comprised of one group that was assigned to the traditional lecture (n = 44) and the other group to the IVRA-FPV tutorial (n = 45). Each participant was then evaluated as they demonstrated the technique on a mannequin to assess their applied learning skillset generalization. Participants that attended the traditional lecture exhibited better answers during oral examination (p < 0.001). There was a trend with no significant difference regarding the evaluation of their applied learning skillset generalization (p = 0.78 n/s). When evaluating the applied learning outcomes for implementing the lumbar puncture, the IVRA-FPV group performed the procedure more efficiently with less errors and in less time (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the IVRA-FPV training may increase the efficiency, by which a larger number of professionals can, in a short time-period, implement techniques reliably and correctly in real-world situations, without the need for expensive equipment. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.",Computer assisted instruction; Educational technology; Lumbar puncture; Medical education; Simulation training; Surgical training; Video-based learning; Virtual reality,,"Ai, Z., Dech, F., Silverstein, J., Rasmussen, M., Tele-immersive medical educational environment (2002) Medicine Meets Virtual Reality 02/10 Digital Upgrades: Applying Moore's Law to Health, pp. 24-30. , Westwood JD, Hoffman HM, Robb RA, Stredney D, (eds), IOS Press Ohmsha; Andersen, S.A.W., Foghsgaard, S., Cayé-Thomasen, P., Sørensen, M.S., The effect of a distributed virtual reality simulation training program on dissection mastoidectomy performance (2018) Otol Neurotol off Publ Am Otol Soc Am Neurotol Soc Eur Acad Otol Neurotol., 39 (10), pp. 1277-1284; Berge, Z.L., Facilitating computer conferencing: Recommendations from the field (1995) Educational Technology, 35 (1), pp. 20-22; Caban, J.J., Joshi, A., Nagy, P., Rapid development of medical imaging tools with open-source libraries (2007) Journal of Digital Imaging, 20, pp. 83-93; Chao, C.J., Wu, S.Y., Yau, Y.J., Feng, W.Y., Tseng, F.Y., Effects of three-dimensional virtual reality and traditional training methods on mental workload and training performance (2017) Human Factors and Ergonomics in Manufacturing, 27 (4), pp. 187-196; Chen, C.M., Wu, C.H., Effects of different video lecture types on sustained attention, emotion, cognitive load, and learning performance (2015) Computers & Education, 80, pp. 108-121; Coppola, N.W., Hiltz, S.R., Rotter, N.G., Becoming a virtual professor: Pedagogical roles and asynchronous learning networks (2014) Journal of Management Information Systems, 18 (4), pp. 169-189; Dang, B.K., Palicte, J.S., Valdez, A., O'Leary-Kelley, C., Assessing simulation, virtual reality, and television modalities in clinical training (2018) Clinical Simulation in Nursing, 19, pp. 30-37; Dardick, J., Allen, S., Scoco, A., Zampolin, R.L., Altschul, D.J., Virtual reality simulation of neuroendovascular intervention improves procedure speed in a cohort of trainees (2019) Surg Neurol Int, 10 (184), pp. 1-4. , https://doi.org/10.25259/SNI_313_2019; Dargar, S., Kennedy, R., Lai, W., Arikatalo, V., De, S., Towards immersive virtual reality (IVR): A route to surgical expertise (2015) Journal of Computational Surgery, 2 (2), pp. 1-26. , DOI: 10.1186/s40244-015-0015-8; Davis, E., Technology transforming healthcare: Tipping points, strange actors, and a singularity (2010) Healthcare and the Effect of Technology: Developments, Challenges, and Advancements, pp. 290-306. , S.M.

Summary of Background Data: Accurate evaluation of craniocervical range of motion is important for early detection of certain diseased conditions and monitoring the progress of interventions. The universal goniometer is widely used for the measurement but it requires experienced practitioners. Whether a combination of virtual reality goggles and smartphone applications can provide the same or better performance compared with the goniometer is still unknown. Methods: Forty-one healthy adults from the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation were recruited for craniocervical range examination (flexion, extension, side-bending to the right or left and rotating to the right or left) by using the hybrid device and universal goniometer. Using the hybrid device, repeated measurements were performed twice by a primary rater and once by a second rater. The primary rater also conducted a measurement using the universal goniometer in the same cohort. The intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)) were calculated using the two-way random effect model, whereas the validity was examined by the Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-and-Altman plot. The interval between the first and second sessions of the measurement for intra-rater reliability was set at 30 min. Results: Excellent intra-rater (ICC ≥ 0.925) and inter-rater (ICC ≥ 0.880) reliability was noted for the hybrid device. The minimal detectable changes from intra-observer and inter-observer comparisons ranged between 4.12° and 7.42° in all six directions. The Bland-and-Altman plot revealed small mean differences (≤1.68°) between the hybrid device and universal goniometer. Both instruments had highly correlated measurements of craniocervical motion (r values ≥ 0.918). Conclusion: For healthy participants, excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability was noted for the hybrid device, and the measurements were consistent with the universal goniometer measurements. Future studies are needed to examine whether the device can perform similarly for patients with neck disorders. © 2019 by the authors.",Goniometer; Neck; Rehabilitation,adult; Article; atlantooccipital joint; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; global positioning system; human; human experiment; hybrid; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; male; mobile application; normal human; physical medicine; range of motion; virtual reality,"Hoy, D.G., Protani, M., De, R., Buchbinder, R., The epidemiology of neck pain (2010) Best Pract.

To achieve this, the support vector machine (SVM) method in machine learning theory has unique advantages, while rough set (RS) theory and SVM complement each other in application. Thus, a new classifier could be created by organically combining these methods to identify fires and provide fire warnings, yielding excellent noise suppression and promotion. Therefore, in this study, an RS is used as the front-end system for the SVM method, yielding improved performance than only SVM. Recognition time is reduced, and recognition efficiency is improved. Experiments show that the RS-SVM classifier model based on parameter optimization proposed in this paper mitigates deficiencies in overfitting and determining local extremum with excellent reliability and stability, and enhances the forecast accuracy of fires. The method also reduces false fire-detection alarms and uses fire feature selection in virtual reality (VR) video images and fire detection and recognition. © 2013 IEEE.",Feature extraction; fire detection; parameter optimization; rough set; support vector machine,Fire detectors; Rough set theory; Support vector machines; Virtual reality; Conventional methods; Forecast accuracy; Noise suppression; Parameter optimization; Recognition efficiency; Recognition time; Reliability and stability; SVM classifiers; Fires,"Nemalidinne, S.M., Gupta, D., Nonsubsampled contourlet domain visible and infrared image fusion framework for fire detection using pulse coupled neural network and spatial fuzzy clustering (2018) Fire Saf.

When designing and communicating these changes they are sometimes simplified while at other times photorealistic representations are used. All the parties involved should trust these representations throughout the entire project. This is not the case today. Representations can be mistrusted, misleading or even misused by certain stakeholders, whilst others regard them as supportive. The overall aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the used representations and the associated risks and benefits that influence communication. While there are several studies in this research area, there are no earlier studies that have investigated the role of representations through long-term, practical projects. Supported by examples from both practical and research studies, the results illustrate how the validity of representations depends on the major project phases. The results illustrate user demands for more supportive object representations, e.g. illustrating possible known object deviations, information on validity and reliability related to objects in context, and for additional clarifications depending on the project phase, especially regarding representations that are too photorealistic. © 2012 IEEE.",environmental planning; photorealism; representations; simplifications; urban planning; validity; Virtual reality,Environmental planning; Photorealism; representations; simplifications; validity; Information science; Urban planning; Virtual reality,"Bishop, I., Lange, E., (2005) Visualization in Landscape and Environmental Planning.

The reliability and validity of diagnoses can be improved with the use of objective physiological measures. Methods: In this study, physiological activity was recorded from 58 male veterans (PTSD Diagnosis n = 16; Trauma Exposed/No PTSD Diagnosis: n = 23; No Trauma/No PTSD Diagnosis: n = 19) with and without PTSD and combat trauma exposure in response to emotionally evocative non-idiographic virtual reality stimuli. Results: Statistically significant differences among the Control, Trauma, and PTSD groups were present during the viewing of two virtual reality videos. Skin conductance and interbeat interval features were extracted for each of ten video events (five events of increasing severity per video). These features were submitted to three stepwise discriminant function analyses to assess classification accuracy for Control versus Trauma, Control versus PTSD, and Trauma versus PTSD pairings of participant groups. Leave-one-out cross-validation classification accuracy was between 71 and 94%. Conclusions: These results are promising and suggest the utility of objective physiological measures in assisting with PTSD diagnosis. The efficacy of physiological activity elicited in response to non-ideographic stimuli for discriminating among veterans with and without PTSD was evaluated. Statistically significant differences were found among the Control, Trauma, and PTSD groups. Features extracted from the physiological signals were submitted to discriminant function analysis and resulted in leave-one-out cross-validated classification accuracies between 72% and 94%. © 2014 The Authors.

In order to handle such complexity while decreasing the time-to-market, immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies are increasingly being used in industry to support product and factory lifecycle engineering processes, such as (re)design, validation and verification, learning and training. However, the design and development of multi-user VR training for complex and manual production processes remain a challenge for industry. The integration of VR training simulations with virtual and physical factories could support the handling of such obstacles in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by increasing the precision, accuracy and reliability of data used in VR simulations. In this study, we present a collaborative and coordinated VR training model and its data integration with virtual factory tools and manufacturing execution systems for a wind turbine assembly scenario. A demonstration has been performed and evaluated by industry experts. The preliminary evaluation results show that integrated collaborative VR training has significant potential for more efficient and effective training, as well as enabling new use cases for industry. © 2019 IEEE.",Collaborative Virtual Reality Training; Virtual Factory; Virtual Reality; Virtual Reality Simulation,Computer aided software engineering; Data integration; Digital storage; Engineering education; Life cycle; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Product design; Virtual reality; Collaborative virtual reality; Design and Development; Immersive virtual reality; Manufacturing Execution System; Validation and verification; Virtual factory; Virtual reality simulations; Virtual reality training; E-learning,"Hermann, M., Pentek, T., Otto, B., Design principles for industrie 4.0 scenarios (2016) Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 3928-3937. , March; Tolio, T., Species-co-evolution of products, processes and production systems (2010) CIRP Ann.-Manuf.

We developed a new proprioception assessment protocol that enables the quantification of elbow position sense without using the opposite arm, involving active movement of the evaluated limb or relying on working memory. The aims of this descriptive study were to validate this assessment protocol by quantifying the elbow position sense of healthy adults, before using it in individuals who sustained a stroke, and to investigate its test-retest reliability. Methods: Elbow joint position sense was quantified using a robotic device and a virtual reality system. Two assessments were performed, by the same evaluator, with a one-week interval. While the participant's arms and hands were occluded from vision, the exoskeleton passively moved the dominant arm from an initial to a target position. Then, a virtual arm representation was projected on a screen placed over the participant's arm. This virtual representation and the real arm were not perfectly superimposed, however. Participants had to indicate verbally the relative position of their arm (more flexed or more extended; two-alternative forced choice paradigm) compared to the virtual representation. Each participant completed a total of 136 trials, distributed in three phases. The angular differences between the participant's arm and the virtual representation ranged from 1° to 27° and changed pseudo-randomly across trials. No feedback about results was provided to the participants during the task. A discrimination threshold was statistically extracted from a sigmoid curve fit representing the relationship between the angular difference and the percentage of successful trials. Test-retest reliability was evaluated with 3 different complementary approaches, i.e. a Bland-Altman analysis, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a standard error of measurement (SEm). Results: Thirty participants (24.6 years old; 17 males, 25 right-handed) completed both assessments. The mean discrimination thresholds were 7.0 ± 2.4 (mean ± standard deviation) and 5.9 ± 2.1 degrees for the first and the second assessment session, respectively. This small difference between assessments was significant (- 1.1 ± 2.2 degrees), however. The assessment protocol was characterized by a fair to good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.47). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the potential of this assessment protocol to objectively quantify elbow position sense in healthy individuals. Futures studies will validate this protocol in older adults and in individuals who sustained a stroke. © 2018 The Author(s).",Assessment; Proprioception; Robotic; Sensory; Stroke; Upper limb; Virtual reality,adult; arm movement; Article; curve fitting; descriptive research; elbow; female; forearm; functional assessment; human; human experiment; image display; male; normal human; perceptive discrimination; position; priority journal; proprioception; stroke patient; test retest reliability; virtual reality; young adult; daily life activity; elbow; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); physiology; procedures; proprioception; reproducibility; stroke rehabilitation; upper limb; validation study; Activities of Daily Living; Adult; Elbow Joint; Exoskeleton Device; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Proprioception; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke Rehabilitation; Upper Extremity; Virtual Reality; Young Adult,"Goble, D.J., Anguera, J.A., Plastic changes in hand proprioception following force-field motor learning (2010) J Neurophysiol, 104, pp. 1213-1215. , 20610787 2944679; Goodwin, G.M., McCloskey, D.I., Matthews, P.B., The contribution of muscle afferents to kinaesthesia shown by vibration induced illusions of movement and by the effects of paralysing joint afferents (1972) Brain, 95, pp. 705-748. , 1:STN:280:DyaE3s%2FotVentQ%3D%3D 4265060; Gandevia, S.C., McCloskey, D.I., Joint sense, muscle sense, and their combination as position sense, measured at the distal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger (1976) J Physiol, 260, pp. 387-407. , 1:STN:280:DyaE2s%2FjtFensg%3D%3D 978533 1309097; Clark, F.J., Burgess, R.C., Chapin, J.W., Proprioception with the proximal interphalangeal joint of the index finger.

Virtual reality simulators have been proposed as potential EBUS-TBNA training instruments, to avoid unskilled beginners practicing directly in real-life settings. A validated and perfected simulation program could be used before allowing beginners to practice on patients. Our goal was to test the reliability of the EBUSSkills and Task Assessment Tool (STAT) and its subscores for measuring the competence of experienced bronchoscopists approaching EBUS-guided TBNA, using only the virtual reality simulator as both a training and an assessment tool. Methods: Fifteen experienced bronchoscopists, with poor or no experience in EBUS-TBNA, participated in this study. They were all administered the Italian version of the EBUS-STAT evaluation tool, during a high-fidelity virtual reality simulation. This was followed by a single 7- hour theoretical and practical (on simulators) session on EBUS-TBNA, at the end of which their skills were reassessed by EBUS-STAT. Results: An overall, significant improvement in EBUSTBNA skills was observed, thereby confirming that (a) virtual reality simulation can facilitate practical learning among practitioners, and (b) EBUS-STAT is capable of detecting these improvements. The test's overall ability to detect differences was negatively influenced by the minimal variation of the scores relating to items 1 and 2, was not influenced by the training, and improved significantly when the 2 items were not considered. Apart from these 2 items, all the remaining subscores were equally capable of revealing improvements in the learner. Lastly, we found that trainees with presimulation EBUS-STAT scores above 79 did not show any significant improvement after virtual reality training, suggesting that this score represents a cutoff value capable of predicting the likelihood that simulation can be beneficial. Conclusions: Virtual reality simulation is capable of providing a practical learning tool for practitioners with previous experience in flexible bronchoscopy, and the EBUS-STAT questionnaire is capable of detecting these changes. A pretraining EBUS-STAT score below 79 is a good indicator of those candidates who will benefit from the simulation training.

These technologies already show their potential in real-life scenarios by providing valuable training, quality control, maintenance, remote control and assistance tools. XR could also favor the development of new metrics and methods in human-robot collaboration (HRC) by providing safe and reproducible testbeds for the standardization of HRI in collaborative scenarios. This can be achieved by attaining a reliability level that would avoid the degradation of user experience in HRI. XR DT systems and interfaces need to be assessed on their impact on the operator, but also in terms of interaction efficacy and efficiency within the virtual scenario. This evaluation should be performed on both virtual reality (VR) visualization and interaction hardware and virtual user interfaces (VUI) in immersive scenarios. There is a lack of evaluation of performance and usability of VUI input methods. Our work aims at assessing three types of input paradigms with a VUI controlling a DT robot arm in a simple pick and place task and which can be based on different VR controller devices. Objective metrics are collected during the task while NASA TLX, SUS and UEQ are used to assess user workload, usability of the system and user experience for each interaction method.

Here, we describe the design and technical development as well as report its feasibility with regards to cybersickness and test-retest reliability in healthy young adults. Method: Our virtual reality paradigm includes two functional scenes (‘City’ and ‘Park’) and four moving dots scenes. Twenty-one healthy young adults were tested twice, one to two weeks apart. They completed a simulator sickness questionnaire several times per session. Their postural sway response was recorded from a forceplate underneath their feet while standing on the floor, stability trainers, or a Both Sides Up (BOSU) ball. Sample entropy, postural displacement, velocity, and excursion were calculated and compared between sessions given the visual and surface conditions. Results: Participants reported slight-to-moderate transient side effects. Intra-Class Correlation values mostly ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 for displacement and velocity, were above 0.5 (stability trainer conditions) and above 0.4 (floor mediolateral conditions) for sample entropy, and minimal for excursion. Conclusion: Our novel portable VR platform was found to be feasible and reliable in healthy young adults. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Balance; Oculus development-kit 2; Rehabilitation; Visual dependence;

Electroencephalography (EEG) may be a strong candidate to evaluate VR sickness objectively. However, no test-retest evaluation has been made for VR sickness using EEG. To recruit VR sickness-sensitive participants, we tested 858 participants (age = 20′s–50′s) using the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ). Among them, we recruited 21 males (average age = 25.0) who obtained the 75th percentile of scores on the MSSQ (32.9 ± 5.7). VR sickness was evaluated twice (one week apart) using EEG with VR video content designed to cause VR sickness. A Simulation Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was also used to evaluate VR sickness. In terms of the reliability of EEG, ICC and Cronbach's alpha analyses showed that three waves (delta, theta, and alpha) were consistent in two areas (frontal and central). A significant difference in EEG was also found repeatedly between the baseline and VR sickness (delta, theta, and alpha) in two areas (frontal and central). We evaluated EEG for its reliability and found specific waves and areas that showed good consistency and significant changes associated with VR sickness. These findings may support further research of VR sickness evaluation. © 2020 The Authors",Cybersickness; Electroencephalography (EEG); Simulation sickness questionnaire (SSQ); Test-retest reliability; Virtual reality (VR),adult; alpha rhythm; Article; controlled study; cybersickness; delta rhythm; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; female; frontal cortex; human; major clinical study; male; motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire; priority journal; questionnaire; reliability; Simulator Sickness Questionnaire; test retest reliability; theta rhythm; adverse event; electroencephalography; middle aged; motion sickness; pathophysiology; photostimulation; procedures; reproducibility; virtual reality; young adult; Adult; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion Sickness; Photic Stimulation; Reproducibility of Results; Virtual Reality; Young Adult,"Silva, J.N.A., Southworth, M., Raptis, C., Silva, J., Emerging applications of virtual reality in cardiovascular medicine (2018) JACC Basic Transl.

Arthroscopy requires a different skill set from traditional open surgery, and many orthopaedic residents feel less prepared for arthroscopic procedures. Virtual reality simulation training and testing provide an opportunity to ensure basic competency before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients. Methods: Twenty-six physicians (thirteen novices and thirteen experienced arthroscopic surgeons) were voluntarily recruited to perform a test consisting of five arthroscopic procedures on a knee arthroscopy simulator. Performance was evaluated by obtaining predefined metrics from the simulator for each procedure, and z-scores, describing suboptimal performance, were calculated from the metrics. The intercase reliability of the simulator metrics was explored by calculating an intraclass correlation coefficient. Finally, a pass-or-fail standard was set with use of the contrasting groups method, and the consequences of the pass-or-fail standard were explored. Results: One procedure was excluded from the final test because of a lack of validity. The total Z-scores for the four procedures included in the final test showed an intercase reliability of 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.93). The total mean z-score (and standard deviation) was 38.6 ± 27.3 points for the novices and 0.0 ± 9.1 points for the experienced surgeons (p < 0.0005). The pass-or-fail standard was set at a total z-score of 15.5 points, resulting in two of the novices passing the test and a single experienced surgeon failing the test. Conclusions: By combining four procedures on a virtual reality arthroscopy simulator, it was possible to create a valid, reliable, and feasible test of basic arthroscopic competency and to establish a credible pass-or-fail standard. Clinical Relevance: The simulation-based test and pass-or-fail standard could aid in assessing and ensuring basic competency of future orthopaedic residents before proceeding to supervised procedures in patients. © 2015 By the journal of bone and joint surgery, incorporated.",,adult; Article; clinical competence; female; human; knee arthroscopy; male; medical education; orthopedic surgeon; priority journal; reliability; simulation training; validity; virtual reality; arthroscopy; computer interface; education; knee; orthopedics; reproducibility; Adult; Arthroscopy; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Knee Joint; Male; Orthopedics; Reproducibility of Results; User-Computer Interface,"Kim, S., Bosque, J., Meehan, J.P., Jamali, A., Marder, R., Increase in outpatient knee arthroscopy in the United States: A comparison of National Surveys of Ambulatory Surgery, 1996 and 2006 (2011) J Bone Joint Surg Am., 93 (11), pp. 994-1000. , Jun 1; Madan, S.S., Pai, D.R., Role of simulation in arthroscopy training (2014) Simul Healthc., 9 (2), pp. 127-135. , Apr; Atesok, K., Mabrey, J.D., Jazrawi, L.M., Egol, K.A., Surgical simulation in orthopaedic skills training (2012) J Am Acad Orthop Surg., 20 (7), pp. 410-422. , Jul; Mabrey, J.D., Reinig, K.D., Cannon, W.D., Virtual reality in orthopaedics: Is it a reality?

This study provides additional reliability and validity data on the Virtual Reality Lateralized Attention Test (VRLAT), an easy-to-administer computerized measure of hemispatial neglect that mimics the attentional demands of real-world tasks, and has previously shown strong validity and sensitivity (Dawson, Buxbaum, & Rizzo, 2008). The present study assessed a large sample of patients with the aim of developing a clinically useful version of the test, and established the concurrent criterion validity of the VRLAT as measured by its association with performance in a real-world task. Method: Seventy consecutively recruited right-hemisphere stroke patients were assessed with the VRLAT, which requires participants to name objects as they navigate (or are navigated) along a winding virtual path. They also performed a real-world navigation task, tests of sensory and motor function, and paper-andpencil neglect tests. Results: The VRLAT demonstrated strong sensitivity and specificity, minimal practice effects, and strong validity, and outperformed traditional paper-and-pencil tests in the prediction of real-world collisions. Conclusions: The VRLAT is a sensitive, valid, and reliable measure of hemispatial neglect that requires no specialized equipment, is easy to administer, and is useful for both clinical and research purposes. Moreover, a shortened version with a 5-min administration time has many of the desirable psychometric properties of the original full-length task. © 2012 American Psychological Association.",Assessment;

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a haptic simulator (IDEA Dental®) could provide a reliable and valid assessment of manual dexterity. A total of 106 participants were divided into three groups differing in dental manual dexterity experience: (i) 63 dental students, (ii) 28 dentists, (iii) 14 non-dentists. The groups, which were expected to display various performance levels, were required to perform virtual drilling tasks in different geometric shapes. The following task parameters were registered: (i) Time to completion (ii) accuracy (iii) number of trials to successful completion and (iv) score provided by the simulator. The reliability of the tasks was calculated for each parameter. The simulator and its scoring algorithm showed high reliability in all the parameters measured. The simulator was able to differentiate between non-professionals and dental students or non-professionals and dentists. Our study suggests that for improved construct validity, shorter working times and more difficult tasks should be introduced. The device should also be designed to provide greater sensitivity in measuring the accuracy of the task. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

This may be assisted by using valid and reliable methods that simulate real-life situations. Interactive virtual reality (VR) technology may introduce various auditory and visual inputs that mimic real-life scenarios. However, evidence supporting the quality and strength of evidence regarding the adequacy of its psychometric properties in assessing the musculoskeletal function has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, this study reviewed the validity and reliability of VR games and real-time feedback in assessing the musculoskeletal system. Recent Findings: Nine studies were included in quality assessment. Based on outcome measures, studies were categorized into range of motion (ROM), balance, reaction time, and cervical motion velocity and accuracy. The majority of the studies were of moderate quality and provided evidence of VR adequate concurrent and, in some cases, known-groups validity. Also, VR showed high intra-rater reliability for most of the measured outcomes. Summary: Based on the included studies, there is a limited promising evidence that interactive VR using games or real-time feedback is highly valid and reliable in assessing ROM in asymptomatic participants and patients with chronic neck pain and radial fracture. For the remaining outcomes, evidence is limited to draw a robust conclusion. Future studies are recommended to test VR psychometric properties in different patients’ population using a rigor research methodology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Exergaming; Musculoskeletal; Psychometric properties; Simulators,accuracy; asymptomatic disease; body equilibrium; chronic pain; evidence based medicine; human; musculoskeletal system examination; neck pain; psychometry; quality control; radius fracture; range of motion; reaction time; reliability; Review; systematic review; validity; velocity; virtual reality,"Atherly, A., van Den Broek-Altenburg, E., Hart, V., Gleason, K., Carney, J., COVID-19, deferred care and telemedicine: A problem, a solution and a potential opportunity (2020) JMIR Public Heal Surveill., , Canada; Haider, Z., Aweid, B., Subramanian, P., Iranpour, F., Telemedicine in orthopaedics and its potential applications during COVID-19 and beyond: A systematic review (2020) J Telemed Telecare, , England, :, A systematic review that provides evidence of telemedicine safety and cost-effectiveness in orthopedics.

The purpose of this series of studies was to explore methods of evaluating reliability and validity evidence for virtual reality assessments (VRAs) when compared with traditional assessments. We intended to provide the basis of a framework on how to evaluate VR assessments given that there are important fundamental differences to VR assessments compared with traditional assessment formats. Two commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) games (i.e., Project M and Richie's Plank Experience) were used in Studies 1 and 2, while a game-based assessment (GBA; Balloon Pop, designed for assessment) was used in Study 3. Studies 1 and 2 provided limited evidence for the reliability and validity of the VRAs. However, no meaningful constructs were measured by the VRA in Study 3. Findings demonstrate limited evidence for these VRAs as viable assessment options through the validity and reliability methods utilized in the present studies, which in turn emphasize the importance of aligning the assessment purpose to the unique advantages of a VR environment. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) games; game-based assessment (GBA); reliability; validity; virtual reality (VR),,"Aalbers, T., Baars, M.A., Rikkert, M.G.O., Kessels, R.P., Puzzling with online games (BAM-COG): Reliability, validity, and feasibility of an online self-monitor for cognitive performance in aging adults (2013) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15 (12). , https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.2860; Abelson, J.L., Curtis, G.C., Cardiac and neuroendocrine responses to exposure therapy in height phobics: Desynchrony within the ‘physiological response system’ (1989) Behaviour Research and Therapy, 27 (5), pp. 561-567. , http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.860.831&rep=rep1&type=pdf; Abraham, R., Emotional intelligence in organizations: A conceptualization (1999) Genetic, Social, and General Psychology Monographs, 125 (2), pp. 209-224. , https://search.proquest.com/openview/0daf5c17e226a3f635d59242ae060697/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=36144; Abraham, R., The role of job control as a moderator of emotional dissonance and emotional intelligence-outcome relationships (2000) Journal of Psychology, 134 (2), pp. 169-184. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980009600860; (2014) Standards for educational and psychological testing, , https://www.apa.org/science/programs/testing/standards, American Educational Research Association; Aïm, F., Lonjon, G., Hannouche, D., Nizard, R., Effectiveness of virtual reality training in orthopaedic surgery (2016) Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic & Related Surgery, 31 (1), pp. 224-232. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2015.07.023; Amir, O., Lobel, O., Driving performance: A growth theory of noncompete law (2012) Stanford Technology Law Review, 16 (3), pp. 833-874. , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2417357; Amstadter, A.B., Daughters, S.B., MacPherson, L., Reynolds, E.K., Danielson, C.K., Wang, F., Potenza, M.N., Lejuez, C.W., Genetic associations with performance on a behavioral measure of distress intolerance (2012) Journal of Psychiatric Research, 46 (1), pp. 87-94. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2011.09.017; Ashton, M.C., Personality and job performance: The importance of narrow traits (1998) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 19 (3), pp. 289-303. , https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199805)19:3<289::AID-JOB841>3.0.CO;2-C; Barrick, M.R., Mount, M.K., The big five personality dimensions and job performance: A meta-analysis (1991) Personnel Psychology, 44 (1), pp. 1-26. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1991.tb00688.x; Bedwell, W.L., Pavlas, D., Heyne, K., Lazzara, E.H., Salas, E., Toward a taxonomy linking game attributes to learning: An empirical study (2012) Simulation & Gaming, 43 (6), pp. 729-760. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1046878112439444; Birzer, M.L., Craig, D.E., Gender differences in police physical ability test performance (1996) American Journal of Police, 15 (2), pp. 93-108. , https://doi.org/10.4324/9781351142847-12; Blais, A.R., Weber, E.U., A Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale for adult populations (2006) Judgment and Decision Making, 1 (1), pp. 33-47. , https://ssrn.com/abstract=1301089; Brown, J.D., Testing-context analysis: Assessment is just another part of language curriculum development (2008) Language Assessment Quarterly, 5 (4), pp. 275-312. , https://doi.org/10.1080/15434300802457455; Buxbaum, L.J., Dawson, A.M., Linsley, D., Reliability and validity of the Virtual Reality Lateralized Attention Test in assessing hemispatial neglect in right-hemisphere stroke (2012) Neuropsychology, 26 (4), pp. 430-441. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0028674; Carmelli, A., The relationship between emotional intelligence and work attitudes, behavior, and outcomes: An examination among senior managers (2003) Journal of Managerial Psychology, 18 (8), pp. 788-813. , https://doi.org/10.1108/02683940310511881; Chan, D., So why ask me?

In three phases, the reliability and validity studies of the scale were performed with a total sample of 440 second, third, and fourth-year undergraduate students studying at various faculties in the 2021–2022 academic year. The face validity and content validity of the scale were examined by obtaining expert opinions. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out with the first group of samples (n = 186) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out with the second group of samples (n = 219). After conducting EFA, the scale had four factors with 18 items, explaining 67.62 percent of the total variance. According to CFA, the construct of the 4-factor with 21 items scale had a good fit with the data. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and test–retest methods reliability coefficient of scale that were calculated to determine the reliability of the measurements were found to be.88 and.89, respectively. The discriminatory power of the items was examined by comparing the participants’ bottom 27 percent and top 27 percent and calculating adjusted item-total correlations. The findings revealed that the educational UTAUT-based virtual reality acceptance scale was a valid and reliable instrument to measure students’ acceptance and use of VR systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Technology acceptance;

This imperfect variability is magnified in larger healthcare or rehabilitation settings since having the same clinician repeat goniometric measures is not always feasible. This study explored the use of virtual reality (VR) as a possible alternative for consistent and reliable shoulder measurements to indicate progress or lack thereof. In a single-blinded study involving physical and occupational therapy students (n=2 each), the inter-rater reliability involving shoulder range of motion (ROM) was tested using a VR technology system (Oculus Rift device and XRHealth software) and compared with the standardized goniometric methods taught in the curriculum. The study found inter-rater reliability for shoulder abduction for the goniometer was “poor-moderate-good,” while the VR showed consistent “poor-good” intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) interpretations. However, shoulder flexion goniometry showed “moderate-good,” while the VR demonstrated “moderate-excellent” and “good-excellent” with left flexion being statistically different (p<0.05). In addition, 65% of subjects (total n=40) stated a preference for having their shoulder ROMs taken with the VR method. Incorporating VR technology into the allied health profession curricula may be a time that has come, especially given the current pandemic circumstances. © 2021 Assoc. of Schools Advancing Health Professions, Wash., DC.",,"human; joint characteristics and functions; physical examination; reproducibility; shoulder; virtual reality; Humans; Physical Examination; Range of Motion, Articular; Reproducibility of Results; Shoulder; Virtual Reality","Fieseler, G, Molitor, T, Irlenbusch, L, Inter- and intrarater reliability of goniometry and hand held dynamometry for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome (2017) J Exerc Rehabil, 13 (6), pp. 704-710. , PMC 5747206; Crasto, JA, Sayari, AJ, Askari, M., Comparative analysis of photograph-based clinical goniometry to standard techniques (2015) Hand, 10, pp. 248-253. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11552-014-9702-2; Irwin, J, Richards, KM, Johnson, MS, An attempt to improve accuracy and reliability of shoulder active range of motion goniometric measurement: a randomized controlled trial (2017) Int J Orth Stud, , https://inscienz.com/journalorthopaedic-studies/IJOS-1-101.php; Ahn, SY, Ko, H, Yoon, JO, Determining the reliability of a new method for measuring joint range of motion through a randomized controlled trial (2019) Ann Rehabil Med, 42 (6), pp. 707-719. , https://doi.org/10.5535/arm.2019.43.6.707; Cornell, S, Field, J, Hutchinson, H, Reliability and validity of the halo digital goniometer for shoulder range of motion in healthy subjects (2018) Int J Sports Phys Ther, 13 (4), pp. 707-714; Shishani, Y, Flocken, J, Gobezie, R., What Is the accuracy of shoulder range of motion measurements on physical exam?

Materials and Methods: Thirty healthy controls underwent SVV test in upright position, with the head tilted to the right 30°, and with the head tilted to the left 30°. Subjects wore SVV VR goggles, which contained a gyroscope for monitoring the angle of head tilt. Each subject completed 10 adjustments in each head position. The mean value of SVV deviations and SVV imprecision (the intra-individual variability of SVV deviations from the 10 adjustments) were recorded and compared across different head positions. The participants then repeated the same SVV protocol at least 1 week later. The test-retest reliability of SVV deviation and SVV imprecision were analyzed. Results: The SVV deviation (mean ± standard deviation) was 0.22° ± 1.56° in upright position,-9.64° ± 5.91° in right head tilt, and 7.20° ± 6.36° in left head tilt. The test-retest reliability of SVV deviation was excellent in upright position (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.77, P < 0.001), right head tilt (ICC = 0.83, P < 0.001) and left head tilt (ICC = 0.84, P < 0.001). The SVV values from the 10 adjustments made during right and left head tilts were less precise than when measured at upright (P < 0.001). The test-retest reliability of SVV imprecision was poor at upright (ICC = 0.21, P = 0.26) but fair-to-good in right head tilt (ICC = 0.72, P < 0.001) and left head tilt (ICC = 0.44, P = 0.04). Conclusion: The test-retest reliability of SVV deviation during lateral head tilts via VR goggles is excellent, which supports further research into the diagnostic value of head-tilt SVV in various vestibular disorders. In addition, the degree of SVV imprecision during head tilt has fair-to-good test-retest reliability, which suggests SVV imprecision may have clinical applicability. © 2020 Tzu Chi Medical Journal | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.",Reliability; Subjective visual vertical; Vestibular perception; Vestibular test,,"MacDougall, HG, Weber, KP, McGarvie, LA, Halmagyi, GM, Curthoys, IS., The video head impulse test: Diagnostic accuracy in peripheral vestibulopathy (2009) Neurology, 73, pp. 1134-1141; Herdman, SJ, Tusa, RJ, Blatt, P, Suzuki, A, Venuto, PJ, Roberts, D., Computerized dynamic visual acuity test in the assessment of vestibular deficits (1998) Am J Otol, 19, pp. 790-796; Todd, NP, Rosengren, SM, Aw, ST, Colebatch, JG., Ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (OVEMPs) produced by air-and bone-conducted sound (2007) Clin Neurophysiol, 118, pp. 381-390; Otero-Millan, J, Treviño, C, Winnick, A, Zee, DS, Carey, JP, Kheradmand, A., The video ocular counter-roll (vOCR): A clinical test to detect loss of otolith-ocular function (2017) Acta Otolaryngol, 137, pp. 593-597; Monsell, EM, Furman, JM, Herdman, SJ, Konrad, HR, Shepard, NT., Computerized dynamic platform posturography (1997) Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 117, pp. 394-398; Colebatch, JG, Halmagyi, GM, Skuse, NF., Myogenic potentials generated by a click-evoked vestibulocollic reflex (1994) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 57, pp. 190-197; Kheradmand, A, Winnick, A., Perception of upright: Multisensory convergence and the role of temporo-parietal cortex (2017) Front Neurol, 8, p. 552; Leigh, RJ, Zee, DS., (2015) The Neurology of Eye Movements, , http://www.oxfordmedicine.com/view/10.1093/med/97801999692890.001.0001/med-9780199969289, Oxford University Press; [Last accessed on 2018 Jul 27]; Dieterich, M, Brandt, T., Ocular torsion and tilt of subjective visual vertical are sensitive brainstem signs (1993) Ann Neurol, 33, pp. 292-299; Dieterich, M, Brandt, T., Wallenberg's syndrome: Lateropulsion, cyclorotation, and subjective visual vertical in thirty-six patients (1992) Ann Neurol, 31, pp. 399-408; Dieterich, M, Brandt, T., Perception of Verticality and Vestibular Disorders of Balance and Falls (2019) Front Neurol, p. 10. , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6457206/, [Last accessed on 2019 Jul 28]; Pinar, HS, Ardiç, FN, Topuz, B, Kara, CO., Subjective visual vertical and subjective visual horizontal measures in patients with chronic dizziness (2005) J Otolaryngol, 34, pp. 121-125; Min, KK, Ha, JS, Kim, MJ, Cho, CH, Cha, HE, Lee, JH., Clinical use of subjective visual horizontal and vertical in patients of unilateral vestibular neuritis (2007) Otol Neurotol, 28, pp. 520-525; Cnyrim, CD, Rettinger, N, Mansmann, U, Brandt, T, Strupp, M., Central compensation of deviated subjective visual vertical in Wallenberg's syndrome (2007) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 78, pp. 527-528; Winnick, A, Sadeghpour, S, Otero-Millan, J, Chang, TP, Kheradmand, A., Errors of Upright Perception in Patients with Vestibular Migraine (2018) Front Neurol, p. 9. , https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2018.00892/full, [Last accessed on 2020 Jun 7]; Böhmer, A, Mast, F., Assessing otolith function by the subjective visual vertical (1999) Ann N Y Acad Sci, 871, pp. 221-231; Zwergal, A, Rettinger, N, Frenzel, C, Dieterich, M, Brandt, T, Strupp, M., A bucket of static vestibular function (2009) Neurology, 72, pp. 1689-1692; Michelson, PL, McCaslin, DL, Jacobson, GP, Petrak, M, English, L, Hatton, K., Assessment of Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) Using the ""Bucket Test"" and the Virtual SVV System (2018) Am J Audiol, 27, pp. 249-259; Chow, SC, Shao, J, Wang, H., (2008) Sample Size Calculations in Clinical Research, , 2nd ed.

However, physical therapists require educational resources to support decision making about game selection to match individual patient goals. Quantifying the movements elicited during virtual reality active video game play can inform individualized game selection in pediatric rehabilitation. Objective: The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate the feasibility and reliability of the Movement Rating Instrument for Virtual Reality Game Play (MRI-VRGP). Methods: Item generation occurred through an iterative process of literature review and sample videotape viewing. The MRI-VRGP includes 25 items quantifying upper extremity, lower extremity, and total body movements. A total of 176 videotaped 90-second game play sessions involving 7 typically developing children and 4 children with cerebral palsy were rated by 3 raters trained in MRI-VRGP use. Children played 8 games on 2 virtual reality and active video game systems. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) determined intra-rater and interrater reliability. Results: Excellent intrarater reliability was evidenced by ICCs of >0.75 for 17 of the 25 items across the 3 raters. Interrater reliability estimates were less precise. Excellent interrater reliability was achieved for far reach upper extremity movements (ICC=0.92 [for right and ICC=0.90 for left) and for squat (ICC=0.80) and jump items (ICC=0.99), with 9 items achieving ICCs of >0.70, 12 items achieving ICCs of between 0.40 and 0.70, and 4 items achieving poor reliability (close-reach upper extremity-ICC=0.14 for right and ICC=0.07 for left) and single-leg stance (ICC=0.55 for right and ICC=0.27 for left). Conclusions: Poor video quality, differing item interpretations between raters, and difficulty quantifying the high-speed movements involved in game play affected reliability. With item definition clarification and further psychometric property evaluation, the MRI-VRGP could inform the content of educational resources for therapists by ranking games according to frequency and type of elicited body movements. © 2016 JMIR Publications Inc.

The opportunity to create ecologically valid stimulation in a highly controlled lab environment is especially relevant for studies of psychiatric disorders, where it can be problematic to confront participants with certain stimuli in real life. However, before VR can be confidently applied widely it is important to establish that commonly used behavioral tasks generate reliable data within a VR surrounding. One field of research that could benefit greatly from VR-applications are studies assessing the reactivity to addiction related cues (cue-reactivity) in participants suffering from gambling disorder. Here we tested the reliability of a commonly used temporal discounting task in a novel VR set-up designed for the concurrent assessment of behavioral and psychophysiological cue-reactivity in gambling disorder. On 2 days, thirty-four healthy non-gambling participants explored two rich and navigable VR-environments (neutral: café vs. gambling-related: casino and sports-betting facility), while their electrodermal activity was measured using remote sensors. In addition, participants completed the temporal discounting task implemented in each VR environment. On a third day, participants performed the task in a standard lab testing context. We then used comprehensive computational modeling using both standard softmax and drift diffusion model (DDM) choice rules to assess the reliability of discounting model parameters assessed in VR. Test–retest reliability estimates were good to excellent for the discount rate log(k), whereas they were poor to moderate for additional DDM parameters. Differences in model parameters between standard lab testing and VR, reflecting reactivity to the different environments, were mostly numerically small and of inconclusive directionality. Finally, while exposure to VR generally increased tonic skin conductance, this effect was not modulated by the neutral versus gambling-related VR-environment. Taken together this proof-of-concept study in non-gambling participants demonstrates that temporal discounting measures obtained in VR are reliable, suggesting that VR is a promising tool for applications in computational psychiatry, including studies on cue-reactivity in addiction. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,"Ghiţă, A., Cue-elicited anxiety and alcohol craving as indicators of the validity of ALCO-VR software: a virtual reality study (2019) J.

Study 1 (n = 36) evaluated an unguided “safe-place” imagery task, where participants were instructed “to create a safe space… [such as] a scene, item, design, or any visual representation that makes you feel safe” using either the Google Tilt Brush application (VR condition), the standard Microsoft Paint application (2-D condition), or via eyes-closed mental imagery alone (IMG condition). Study 2 (n = 48) evaluated a narrative episodic recall task, where participants viewed their childhood and adult homes and places of schooling either using either the Google Earth VR application (VR condition) or the standard Google Earth application (2-D condition) or recalled these places with their eyes closed via mental imagery alone (IMG condition). Finally, Study 3 (n = 48) evaluated a guided wilderness imagery task, during which different scripts were narrated, specifically, a trail walk in autumn, a spring meadow, and a hillside walk in snowy winter, while either these same scenes were visually presented using the Nature Treks VR application (VR condition), the scenes were presented using the same software but shown on standard computer monitor (2-D condition), or participants’ eyes were closed (IMG condition). Order of intervention format was randomized across participants. Across all three studies, quantitative survey ratings showed that the VR format of intervention delivery produced greater positive affect and satisfaction and perceived credibility ratings as an intervention for trauma- and stressor-related disorders and psychological well-being as rated by university students who varied in traumatic and stressful life event history and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, whereas qualitative findings revealed additional themes of experiential response including increased experience of presence and vividness in the VR condition. Future research directions and clinical applications are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Frewen, Mistry, Zhu, Kielt, Wekerle, Lanius and Jetly.",dissociative experiences; integrative psychotherapy; positive affect (PA); posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); virtual reality; wellbeing,,"Anderson, C.L., Monroy, M., Keltner, D., Awe in nature heals: evidence from military veterans, at-risk youth, and college students (2018) Emotion, 18, pp. 1195-1202. , 29927260; Andrade, J., May, J., Deeprose, C., Baugh, S., Ganis, G., Assessing vividness of mental imagery: the plymouth sensory imagery questionnaire (2013) Br.

This study compared measurements of levator ani hiatal volume during rest and on maximum Valsalva, obtained using conventional three-dimensional (3D) translabial ultrasound and virtual reality imaging. Our objectives were to establish their agreement and reliability, and their relationship with prolapse symptoms and POP quantification (POP-Q) stage. Methods One hundred women with an intact levator ani were selected from our tertiary clinic database. Information on clinical symptoms were obtained using standardized questionnaires. Ultrasound datasets were analyzed using a rendered volume with a slice thickness of 1.5 cm, at the level of minimal hiatal dimensions, during rest and on maximum Valsalva. The levator area (in cm2 ) was measured and multiplied by 1.5 to obtain the levator ani hiatal volume (in cm3 ) on conventional 3D ultrasound. Levator ani hiatal volume (in cm3 ) was measured semi-automatically by virtual reality imaging using a segmentation algorithm. Twenty patients were chosen randomly to analyze intra-and interobserver agreement. Results The mean difference between levator hiatal volume measurements on 3D ultrasound and by virtual reality was 1.52 cm3 (95% CI, 1.00–2.04 cm3 ) at rest and 1.16 cm3 (95% CI, 0.56–1.76 cm3 ) during maximum Valsalva (P &lt; 0.001). Both intra-and interobserver intra-class correlation coefficients were ≥ 0.96 for conventional 3D ultrasound and &gt; 0.99 for virtual reality. Patients with prolapse symptoms or POP-Q Stage ≥ 2 had significantly larger hiatal measurements than those without symptoms or POP-Q Stage &lt; 2. Conclusions Levator ani hiatal volume at rest and on maximum Valsalva is significantly smaller when using virtual reality compared with conventional 3D ultrasound; however, this difference does not seem clinically impor-tant.

Methods: Two intervention sessions for each of 11 children (total, 22) were videotaped; sessions were provided by 4 physical therapists. Videotapes were divided into usual and VR components and rated by 2 observers using the MLSRI. A generalizability theory approach was used to determine interrater reliability for each intervention. Results: Interrater reliability for usual interventions was high for the MLSRI total score (g-coefficient, 0.81), whereas it was low for the VR total score (g-coefficient, 0.28); MLSRI category g-coefficients varied from 0.35 to 0.65 for usual and from 0.17 to 0.72 for VR interventions. Conclusion: Adequate reliability was achieved within ratings of usual interventions; however, challenges related to MLSRI use to rate VR-based interventions require further evaluation. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams Wilkins.",adolescent; brain injuries/rehabilitation; child; clinical decision making; disabled children/rehabilitation; motor skills; physical therapy modalities; psychomotor performance; reproducibility of results; sensory feedback; therapy/computer assisted methods,adolescent; article; brain injury; child; computer interface; computer system; disability; equipment; evaluation; female; human; male; motor performance; observer variation; physiology; physiotherapy; reproducibility; virtual reality exposure therapy; Adolescent; Brain Injuries; Child; Computer Systems; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Skills; Observer Variation; Physical Therapy Modalities; Reproducibility of Results; User-Computer Interface; Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy,"Taylor, H.G., Research on outcomes of pediatric traumatic brain injury: Current advances and future directions (2004) Dev Neuropsych, 25 (1-2), pp. 199-225; Dumas, H.M., Haley, S.M., Carey, T.M., Shen, N.P., The relationship between functional mobility and the intensity of physical therapy intervention in children with traumatic brain injury (2004) Pediatr Phys Ther, 16, pp. 157-164; Haley, S.M., Baryza, M.J., Webster, H.C., Pediatric rehabilitation and recovery of children with traumatic brain injuries (1992) Pediatr Phys Ther, 4, pp. 24-30; Beaulieu, C.L., Rehabilitation and outcome following pediatric traumatic brain injury (2002) Surg Clin North Am, 82 (2), pp. 393-408; Teplicky, R., Law, M., Rosenbaum, P., Stewart, D., Dematteo, C., Rumney, P., Effective rehabilitation for children and adolescents with brain injury: Evaluating and disseminating the evidence (2005) Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 86 (5), pp. 924-931; Nudo, R.J., Plautz, E.J., Frost, S.B., Role of adaptive plasticity in recovery of function after damage to motor cortex (2001) Muscle Nerve, 24 (8), pp. 1000-1019; Whyte, J., Hart, H., It's more than a black box; It's a Russian doll: Defining rehabilitation treatments (2003) Am J PhysMed Rehabil, 82 (8), p. 639; Giza, C.C., Kolb, B., Harris, N.G., Asarnow, R.F., Prins, M.L., Hitting a moving target: Basic mechanisms of recovery from acquired developmental brain injury (2009) Dev Neurorehabil, 12 (5), pp. 255-268; Schmidt, R.A., Lee, T.D., (2005) Motor Control and Learning: A Behavioral Emphasis, , 4th ed.

The focus in this paper was technology development with iterative and proof-of-concept testing. Three versions of a wheelchair simulator that were designed and developed for simulating curvilinear wheelchair propulsion in virtual reality were tested for their validity and reliability. The wheelchair simulators comprise a sophisticated wheelchair ergometer in an immersive virtual reality environment and are developed for manual wheelchair propulsion. These simulators all replicate inertia in translation, in addition to taking three approaches for simulating turning. The three systems were then tested and compared with the real world to see how reliable and valid they are; 15 healthy participants were recruited to perform the Illinois Agility Test (IAT) in two sessions that were at least one week apart. The intraclass correlation coefficient and the Pearson correlation coefficient were found for 16 variables to find the test-retest reliability and convergent construct validity of the systems, respectively. Overall, the three systems showed good validity and reliability with the VRsystem 2 (mechanical compensation for rotational inertia) having the best scores and the VRsystem 3 (software compensation for rotational inertia) having the lowest scores. Also, it was observed that performing IAT in the real world needed fewer pushes and often accompanied more negative pushes. Participants also used longer strokes in the real world compared to virtual reality environment. © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Construct validity; curvilinear inertia compensation; test-retest reliability; virtual reality; wheelchair ergometer,Correlation methods; Neuromuscular rehabilitation; Propulsion; Simulators; Software reliability; Virtual reality; Activities of Daily Living; Construct validity; Inertia compensations; Intraclass correlation coefficients; Manual wheelchair propulsions; Pearson correlation coefficients; Test-retest reliability; Virtual-reality environment; Wheelchairs; Article; construct validity; content validity; controlled study; daily life activity; feedback system; human; human experiment; kinematics; knee function; mathematical parameters; measurement accuracy; motion; proof of concept; quadriceps femoris muscle; reliability; test retest reliability; validity; velocity; virtual reality; biomechanics; computer simulation; energy metabolism; equipment design; mechanics; normal human; reproducibility; wheelchair; Activities of Daily Living; Biomechanical Phenomena; Computer Simulation; Energy Metabolism; Equipment Design; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Mechanical Phenomena; Reproducibility of Results; Virtual Reality; Wheelchairs,"Silfverskiold, J., Waters, R.L., Shoulder pain and functional disability in spinal cord injury patients (1991) Clin.

We developed a virtual reality (VR) based test and investigated whether either test of spatial navigation was reliable. Objective: To examine test-retest reliability of the real-world and VR triangle completion tests. A secondary objective was to examine the usability of the VR based test. Materials and methods: Thirty healthy adults aged 18–45 years were recruited to this block randomized study. Participants completed two sessions of triangle completion tests in the real-world and VR on the same day with a break between sessions. Results: In both test versions distance from the endpoint and angle of deviation showed poor test-retest reliability (r < 0.5). Distance traveled had moderate reliability in both the real-world and VR tests (r = 0.55 95% CI [0.23, 0.76]; r = 0.66 95% CI [0.4, 0.83, respectively]). The VR triangle test showed poor correlation with the real-world test. Conclusion: The triangle completion test has poor test-retest reliability and demonstrates poor concurrent validity between the real-world and VR. Nevertheless, it was feasible to translate a real-world test of spatial navigation into VR. VR provides opportunities for development of clinically relevant spatial navigation tests in the future.

This study aimed to assess the test-retest reliability and convergent and ecological validity of a newly developed, virtual-reality, concussion assessment tool, 'CONVIRT', which uses eye-tracking technology to assess visual processing speed, and manual reaction time (pushing a button on a riding crop) to assess attention and decision-making. CONVIRT was developed for horse jockeys, as of all sportspersons, they are most at risk of concussion. Methods: Participants (N = 165), were assessed with CONVIRT, which uses virtual reality to give the user the experience of riding a horse during a horserace. Participants were also assessed with standard Cogstate computer-based concussion measures in-between two completions of the CONVIRT battery. The physiological arousal induced by the test batteries were assessed via measures of heart rate and heart rate variability (LF/HF ratio). Results: Satisfactory test-retest reliability and convergent validity with Cogstate attention and decision-making subtests and divergent validity in visual processing speed measures were observed. CONVIRT also increased heart rate and LF/HF ratio, which may better approximate participant arousal levels in their workplace. Conclusions: CONVIRT may be a reliable and valid tool to assess elements of cognition and CNS disruption. The increased ecological validity may also mean better informed 'return-to-play' decisions and stronger industry acceptance due to the real-world meaningfulness of the assessment. However, before this can be achieved, the sensitivity of the CONVIRT battery needs to be demonstrated. © 2020 The Author(s).",Assessment; Concussion; Eye-tracking; Mild traumatic brain injury; VR,adolescent; adult; attention; brain concussion; cognition; female; human; male; neuropsychological test; physiology; reaction time; reproducibility; virtual reality; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Brain Concussion; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Reproducibility of Results; Virtual Reality; Young Adult,"Khurana, V.G., Kaye, A.H., An overview of concussion in sport (2012) J Clin Neurosci, 19 (1), pp. 1-11; McCrea, M., Guskiewicz, K.M., Randolph, C., Barr, W.B., Hammeke, T.A., Marshall, S.W., Effects of a symptom-free waiting period on clinical outcome and risk of reinjury after sport-related concussion (2009) Neurosurgery., 65 (5), pp. 882-883; Turner, M., McCrory, P., Halley, W., Injuries in professional horse racing in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland during 1992-2000 (2002) Br J Sports Med, 36 (AUGUST), pp. 403-409. , 12453834 1724574; Hitchens, P.L., Blizzard, C.L., Jones, G., Day, L.M., Fell, J., The incidence of race-day jockey falls in Australia, 2002-2006 (2009) Med J Aust, 190 (2), pp. 83-86. , 19236295; Orchard, J., Seward, H., Orchard, J., (2014) AFL Injury Report.

We have developed a virtual reality rehabilitation system with multimodal sensory feedback and applied it to six patients with brachial plexus avulsion or arm amputation. In an experiment, patients executed a reaching task using a virtual phantom limb displayed in a three-dimensional computer graphic environment manipulated by their real intact limb. The intensity of the phantom limb pain was evaluated through a short-form McGill pain questionnaire. The experiments were conducted twice on different days at more than four-week intervals for each patient. The reliability of our task's ability to relieve pain was demonstrated by the test-retest method, which checks the degree of the relative similarity between the pain reduction rates in two experiments using Fisher's intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC was 0.737, indicating sufficient reproducibility of our task. The average of the reduction rates across participants was 50.2%, and it was significantly different from 0 (p < 0:001). Overall, our findings indicate that neurorehabilitation using our multimodal virtual reality system reduces the phantom limb pain with sufficient reliability. © 2015 IEEE.",,computer interface; human; neurorehabilitation; phantom limb; procedures; Humans; Neurological Rehabilitation; Phantom Limb; User-Computer Interface,"Ramachandran, V.S., Hirstein, W., The perception of phantom limbs.

Method: Participants (N=40) were recruited by the authors and were screened for eligibility. The initial method of measurement was randomized to either virtual reality (VR) or clinically based measures (CM). Physical performance tests included the five times sit to stand, Timed Up and Go (TUG), Forward Functional Reach (FFR) and 30-s stand test. A random number generator determined the testing order. The test-re-test reliability for the VR and CM was determined. Furthermore, concurrent validity was determined using a Pearson product moment correlation (Pearson r). Results: The VR demonstrated excellent reliability for 5×STS intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.931(3,1), FFR ICC=0.846(3,1) and the TUG ICC=0.944(3,1). The concurrent validity data for the VR and CM (ICC 3, k) were moderate for FFR ICC=0.682, excellent 5×STS ICC=0.889 and excellent for the TUG ICC=0.878. The concurrent validity of the 30-s stand test was good ICC=0.735(3,1). Conclusions: This study supports the use of VR equipment for measuring physical performance tests in the clinic for healthy community-dwelling elders.Implications for RehabilitationVirtual reality equipment is not only used to treat balance impairments but it is also used to measure and determine physical impairments through the use of physical performance tests.Virtual reality equipment is a reliable and valid tool for collecting physical performance data for the 5×STS, FFR, TUG and 30-s stand test for healthy community-dwelling elders. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

Study Design: Laboratory. Methods: Forty participants performed 3 drop vertical jumps evaluated by 3-dimensional motion analysis and 3 drop vertical jumps evaluated by the VR game. Limits of agreement for the peak projected frontal plane knee angle and peak knee abduction were determined. Participants were given a consensus category of ""above threshold"" or ""below threshold"" based on a prespecified threshold angle of 9° during landing. Classification agreement was determined using kappa coefficient, and accuracy was determined using specificity and sensitivity. Ten participants returned 1 week later to determine intrarater reliability, standard error of the measure, and typical error. Results: The mean difference in detected frontal plane knee angle was 3.39° (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03° to 5.74°). Limits of agreement were -10.27° (95% CI, -14.36° to -6.19°) to 17.05° (95% CI, 12.97° to 21.14°). Substantial agreement, specificity, and sensitivity were observed for the threshold classification (κ = .66; 95% CI, .42 to .88; specificity = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.0; and sensitivity = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.95). The game exhibited acceptable reliability over time (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC3,1 = .844), and error was approximately 2°. Conclusion: The VR game reliably evaluated a projected frontal plane knee angle. Although the knee angle detected by the VR game is strongly related to peak knee abduction, the accuracy of detecting the exact angle was limited. A threshold approach may be a more accurate approach for gaming technology to evaluate frontal plane knee angles when landing from a jump. © 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Feedback; Game technology; Kinematics,abduction; adult; article; clinical article; consensus; controlled study; correlation coefficient; female; human; human experiment; intrarater reliability; kappa statistics; kinematics; knee; male; motion; sensitivity and specificity; validity; virtual reality,"Borowski, L.A., Yard, E.E., Fields, S.K., Comstock, R.D., The epidemiology of US high school basketball injuries, 2005-2007 (2008) Am J Sports Med, 36 (12), pp. 2328-2335. , PubMed ID: 18765675; Stuelcken, M.C., Mellifont, D.B., Gorman, A.D., Sayers, M.G.L., Mechanisms of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in elite women's netball: a systematic video analysis (2016) J Sports Sci, 34 (16), pp. 1516-1522. , PubMed ID: 26644060; Malinzak, R.A., Colby, S.M., Kirkendall, D.T., Yu, B., Garrett, W.E., A comparison of knee joint motion patterns between men and women in selected athletic tasks (2001) Clin Biomech, 16 (5), pp. 438-445; Holden, S., Boreham, C., Doherty, C., Wang, D., Delahunt, E., Clinical assessment of countermovement jump landing kinematics in early adolescence: sex differences and normative values (2015) Clin Biomech, 30 (5), pp. 469-474; Taylor, J.B., Waxman, J.P., Richter, S.J., Shultz, S.J., Evaluation of the effectiveness of anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programme training components: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2015) Br J Sports Med, 49 (2), pp. 79-87. , PubMed ID: 23922282; Agel, J., Arendt, E.A., Bershadsky, B., Anterior cruciate ligament injury in national collegiate athletic association basketball and soccer: a 13-year review (2005) Am J Sports Med, 33 (4), pp. 524-531. , PubMed ID: 15722283; Pfeiffer, R.P., Shea, K.G., Roberts, D., Grandstrand, S., Bond, L., Lack of effect of a knee ligament injury prevention program on the incidence of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury (2006) J Bone Joint Surg Am, 88 (8), pp. 1769-1774. , PubMed ID: 16882900; (2015) Involvement in Organised Sport and Physical Activity, 1, pp. 1-4. , http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/4177.02013-14?, 1st ed.

In this paper, a terahertz (THz) cellular network is considered to provide high-rate VR services, thus enabling a successful visual perception. For this network, guaranteeing URLLC with high rates requires overcoming the uncertainty stemming from the THz channel. To this end, the achievable reliability and latency of VR services over THz links are characterized. In particular, a novel expression for the probability distribution function of the transmission delay is derived as a function of the system parameters. Subsequently, the end-to-end (E2E) delay distribution that takes into account both processing and transmission delay is found and a tractable expression of the reliability of the system is derived as a function of the THz network parameters such as the molecular absorption loss and noise, the transmitted power, and the distance between the VR user and its respective small base station (SBS). Numerical results show the effects of various system parameters such as the bandwidth and the region of non-negligible interference on the reliability of the system. In particular, the results show that THz can deliver rates up to 16.4 Gbps and a reliability of 99.999% (with a delay threshold of 30 ms) provided that the impact of the molecular absorption on the THz links, which substantially limits the communication range of the SBS, is alleviated by densifying the network accordingly. © 2019 IEEE.",Reliability; Terahertz; Ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC); Virtual reality (VR),Distribution functions; Mobile telecommunication systems; Virtual reality; Communication range; Delay distributions; Low-latency communication; Molecular absorption; Network parameters; Tera Hertz; Terahertz frequencies; Transmission delays; Reliability,"Saad, W., Bennis, M., Chen, M., (2019) A Vision of 6G Wireless Systems: Applications, Trends, Technologies, and Open Research Problems; ElBamby, M.S., Perfecto, C., Bennis, M., Doppler, K., Towards lowlatency and ultra-reliable virtual reality (2018) IEEE Network, 32 (2), pp. 78-84. , Apr; Gerardino, G., Alvarez, B., Pedersen, K., Mogensen, P., MAC layer enhancements for ultra-reliable low-latency communications in cellular networks Proc.

The levator area (in cm 2) was measured and multiplied by 1.5 to get the levator ani hiatus volume in conventional 3D ultrasound (in cm 3). Levator ani hiatus volume measurements were then measured semi-automatically in virtual reality (cm 3) using a segmentation algorithm. An intra- and interobserver analysis of reliability and agreement was performed in 20 randomly chosen patients. Results: The mean difference between levator ani hiatus volume measurements performed using conventional 3D ultrasound and virtual reality was 0.10 (95% CI, - 0.15 to 0.35) cm 3. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) comparing conventional 3D ultrasound with virtual reality measurements was &gt; 0.96. Intra- and interobserver ICCs for conventional 3D ultrasound measurements were &gt; 0.94 and for virtual reality measurements were &gt; 0.97, indicating good reliability for both. Conclusion: Levator ani hiatus volume measurements performed using virtual reality were reliable and the results were similar to those obtained with conventional 3D ultrasonography.

Experience in the procedure is currently attained via supervised clinical practice that is challenged by patient availability and risks. Prior simulation-based training and subsequent assessment could improve and ensure competence before performance on patients, but no simulator currently exists. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) is a new promising simulation tool that can replicate complex interactions and environments that are unfeasible to achieve by traditional simulators. This study was aimed at developing an IVR simulation-based test for core CEUS competencies and gathering validity evidence for the test in accordance with Messick's framework. The test was developed by IVR software specialists and clinical experts in CEUS and medical education and imitated a CEUS examination of a patient with a focal liver lesion with emphasis on the pre-contrast preparations. Twenty-five medical doctors with varying CEUS experience were recruited as test participants, and their results were used to analyze test quality and to establish a pass/fail standard. The final test of 23 test items had good internal reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.85) and discriminatory abilities. The risks of false positives and negatives (9.1% and 23.6%, respectively) were acceptable for the test to be used as a certification tool prior to supervised clinical training in CEUS. © 2022 The Authors",Contrast-enhanced ultrasound; Immersive virtual reality; Medical education; Simulation-based medical education; Ultrasound contrast agent; Validity evidence,Diagnosis; E-learning; Medical imaging; Software testing; Testing; Ultrasonics; Virtual reality; Contrast enhanced ultrasound; Diagnostic imaging; Imaging tools; Immersive virtual reality; Medical specialties; Procedural guidances; Simulation-based medical education; Ultrasound contrast agent; Validity evidence; Virtual reality simulations; Medical education; Article; contrast-enhanced ultrasound; evidence based practice; human; medical education; physician; reliability; virtual reality; clinical competence; computer simulation; echography; procedures; reproducibility; simulation training; Clinical Competence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; Ultrasonography; Virtual Reality,"Al-Elq, A.H., Simulation-based medical teaching and learning (2010) J Family Community Med, 17, pp. 35-40; Standards for educational and psychological testing (1999), AERA Washington, DC; Barr, R.G., Huang, P., Luo, Y., Xie, X., Zheng, R., Yan, K., Jing, X., Lee, J.M., Contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging of the liver: A review of the clinical evidence for SonoVue and Sonazoid (2020) Abdom Radiol (NY), 45, pp. 3779-3788; Bloch, R., Norman, G., Generalizability theory for the perplexed: A practical introduction and guide: AMEE Guide No. 68 (2012) Med Teach, 34, pp. 960-992; Borgersen, N.J., Naur, T.M.H., Sørensen, S.M.D., Bjerrum, F., Konge, L., Subhi, Y., Thomsen, A.S.S., Gathering validity evidence for surgical simulation: A systematic review (2018) Ann Surg, 267, pp. 1063-1068; Chong, W.K., Papadopoulou, V., Dayton, P.A., Imaging with ultrasound contrast agents: Current status and future (2018) Abdom Radiol (NY), 43, pp. 762-772; Cook, D.A., Much ado about differences: Why expert-novice comparisons add little to the validity argument (2015) Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract, 20, pp. 829-834; Cook, D.A., Hatala, R., Validation of educational assessments: A primer for simulation and beyond (2016) Adv Simul (Lond), 1, p. 31; Cook, D.A., Brydges, R., Zendejas, B., Hamstra, S.J., Hatala, R., Technology-enhanced simulation to assess health professionals: A systematic review of validity evidence, research methods, and reporting quality (2013) Acad Med, 88, pp. 872-883; Cook, D.A., Zendejas, B., Hamstra, S.J., Hatala, R., Brydges, R., What counts as validity evidence?

We used a new virtual reality paradigm to experimentally investigate the impact of contingent behavior on trust along the paranoia continuum. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly allocated to have a social interaction with a pleasant virtual human (avatar) programmed to be highly responsive or not (high/low contingency). Perceived trustworthiness and trusting behavior were assessed alongside control variables attachment and anxiety. Higher paranoia and dismissive attachment were associated with larger interpersonal distances. Unexpectedly, extremely paranoid individuals experienced the highly contingent avatar as more trustworthy than their low contingency counterpart. Higher dismissive attachment was also associated with more subjective trust in both conditions. Extreme paranoia is associated with hypersensitivity to noncontingent behavior, which might explain experiences of mistrust when others are not highly responsive in everyday social situations. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although validity has been a focus in VR research, little attention has been paid to other psychometric properties such as test-retest reliability and practice effects. Practice effects are common on traditional neuropsychological tests and can be impacted by novelty. Because VR is not widely used it was expected that participants would demonstrate higher practice effects on VR as compared to paper-and-pencil testing. Method: To compare test-retest reliability and practice effects in VR and traditional paper-and-pencil testing, the Virtual Environment Grocery Store (VEGS) and California Verbal Learning Test–Second Edition (CVLT-II) were used in healthy adults (n = 44). Participants received follow-up testing approximately 2 weeks after the initial visit. Results: Significant practice effects of similar magnitude were seen on memory scores (i.e., total learning, long-delay free recall, and long-delay cued recall) on the VEGS and the CVLT-II. The VEGS and CVLT-II memory scores also demonstrated strong test-retest reliability (r’s >.71). Lastly, total learning scores (d = .32) and long-delay cued recall (d = .70) scores were significantly higher on the CVLT-II compared to the VEGS (p’s <.01). Conclusions: Results suggested similar test-retest reliability and practice effects of the VEGS and CVLT-II, although the VEGS has the benefit of being an immersive technology that simulates an everyday activity. The study replicated past findings that the VEGS is more difficult than the CVLT-II which may be a useful property for clinical assessment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",CVLT-II; Neuropsychological assessment; practice effects; test-retest reliability; virtual environment grocery store,adult; attention; human; neuropsychological test; reproducibility; verbal learning; virtual reality; Adult; Attention; Humans; Neuropsychological Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Supermarkets; Verbal Learning; Virtual Reality,"Allain, P., Foloppe, D.A., Besnard, J., Yamaguchi, T., Etcharry-Bouyx, F., Le Gall, D., Nolin, P., Richard, P., Detecting everyday action deficits in Alzheimer’s disease using a nonimmersive virtual reality kitchen (2014) Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 20 (5), pp. 468-477. , https://doi.org/10.1017/s1355617714000344; An, K.Y., Zakzanis, K.K., Joordens, S., Conducting research with non-clinical healthy undergraduates: Does effort play a role in neuropsychological test performance?

An existing tracker solution is used to map input (actions and movements) in VR. The main challenge was integrating some of the default functionalities existing in current commercial VR controllers, while providing an empathic setup and a use-case for disability rehabilitation, as well as keeping the controller compact, lightweight, and handheld. The prototyping process followed a human-centred explorative design idea generation. Only limited functionality of existing commercial controllers was maintained, with the feasibility and readiness for implementing additional functionalities to use the controller with existing applications and future use cases. An experiment was performed to investigate the usability of the system and the effectiveness and reliability of the controller in empathic re-mapping of real-life disability to VR. © ICDC 2020.",Empathetic design; Healthcare design; Human-centered design; Rehabilitation; Virtual reality,Virtual reality; Design ideas; Handhelds; Idea generation; Physical mobility; Proof of concept; Prototyping process; Remapping; Upper limbs; Controllers,"Adamovich, S.

Very few assessment tools are available for evaluating performance in thoracoscopic procedures. Video recordings would provide the possibility of blinded assessment and limited rater bias. This study aimed to provide validity evidence for a newly developed and dedicated tool for assessing competency in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: Participants with varying experience with VATS lobectomy were included from different countries. Video recordings from participants’ performance of a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy on a virtual reality simulator were rated by three raters using a modified version of a newly developed VATS lobectomy assessment tool (the VATSAT) and analyzed in relation to the unitary framework (content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences of testing). Results: Fifty-three participants performed two consecutive simulated VATS lobectomies on the virtual reality simulator, leaving a total of 106 videos. Content established in previously published studies. Response process Standardized data collection was ensured by using an instructional element, uniform data collection, a special rating program, and automatic generation of the results to a database. Raters were carefully instructed in using the VATSAT, and tryout ratings were carried out. Internal structure Inter-rater reliability was calculated as intra-class correlation coefficients, to 0.91 for average measures (p < 0.001). Test/re-test reliability was calculated as Pearson’s r of 0.70 (p < 0.001). G-coefficient was calculated to be 0.79 with two procedures and three raters. By performing D-theory was found that either three procedures rated by two raters or five procedures rated by one rater were enough to reach an acceptable G-coefficient of ≥ 0.8. Relation to other variables Significant differences between groups were found (p < 0.001). The participants’ VATS lobectomy experience correlated significantly to their VATSAT score (p = 0.016). Consequences of testing The pass/fail score was found to be 14.9 points by the contrasting groups’ method, leaving five false positive (29%) and six false negatives (43%). Conclusion: Validity evidence was provided for the VATSAT according to the unitary framework. The VATSAT provides supervisors and assessors with a procedure-specific assessment tool for evaluating VATS lobectomy performance and aids with the decision of when the trainee is ready for unsupervised performance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Assessment tool; Competence evaluation; Thoracoscopic lobectomy; VATS; VATSAT,"Article; Australia; Belgium; clinical assessment; computer simulation; consequences of testing; content; correlation coefficient; Denmark; false negative result; Finland; Germany; human; information processing; internal structure; interrater reliability; Ireland; lobectomy; major clinical study; medical ethics; medical student; multicenter study; outcome assessment; priority journal; relation to other variable; response process; Spain; surgical training; Switzerland; thoracic surgeon; thorax surgery; United Kingdom; validity; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; videorecording; virtual reality; adult; clinical competence; education; female; lung resection; male; procedures; reproducibility; simulation training; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Denmark; Female; Humans; Male; Pneumonectomy; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; Students, Medical; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Virtual Reality; Young Adult","Epstein, R.M., Cassel, C.K., Epstein, R.M., de Galan, B.E., van Gurp, P.J., Stuyt, P.M., Assessment in medical education (2007) N Engl J Med, 356, pp. 387-396; Lodge, D., Grantcharov, T., Training and assessment of technical skills and competency in cardiac surgery (2011) Eur J Cardio-Thorac Surg, 39, pp. 287-293; Darzi, A., Datta, V., Mackay, S., The challenge of objective assessment of surgical skill (2001) Am J Surg, 181, pp. 484-486; Mcgaghie, W.C., Mastery learning: it is time for medical education to join the 21st century (2015) Acad Med, 90, pp. 1-4; Sharma, B., Mishra, A., Aggarwal, R., Grantcharov, T.P., Non-technical skills assessment in surgery (2011) Surg Oncol, 20, pp. 169-177; Ahmed, K., Miskovic, D., Darzi, A., Athanasiou, T., Hanna, G.B., Observational tools for assessment of procedural skills: a systematic review (2011) Am J Surg, 202, pp. 469-480; Konge, L., Lehnert, P., Hansen, H.J., Petersen, R.H., Ringsted, C., Reliable and valid assessment of performance in thoracoscopy (2012) Surg Endosc, 26, pp. 1624-1628; Tong, B.C., Gustafson, M.R., Balderson, S.S., D’Amico, T.A., Meyerson, S.L., Validation of a thoracoscopic lobectomy simulator (2012) Eur J Cardio-Thorac Surg, 42, pp. 364-369; Konge, L., Larsen, K.R., Clementsen, P., Arendrup, H., Von Buchwald, C., Ringsted, C., Reliable and valid assessment of clinical bronchoscopy performance (2012) Respiration, 83, pp. 53-60; Weizman, N.F., Manoucheri, E., Vitonis, A.F., Hicks, G.J., Einarsson, J.I., Cohen, S.L., Design and validation of a novel assessment tool for laparoscopic suturing of the vaginal cuff during hysterectomy (2015) J Surg Educ, 72, pp. 212-219; Carlsen, C.G., Lindorff-Larsen, K., Funch-Jensen, P., Lund, L., Charles, P., Konge, L., Reliable and valid assessment of Lichtenstein hernia repair skills (2014) Hernia, 18, pp. 543-548; Aggarwal, R., Grantcharov, T., Moorthy, K., Milland, T., Darzi, A., Toward feasible, valid, and reliable video-based assessments of technical surgical skills in the operating room (2008) Ann Surg, 247, pp. 372-379; Yang, S.C., Merrill, W., Educational milestone development in phase II specialties: thoracic surgery (2014) j Gr Med Educ, 6, pp. 329-331; Messick, S., Meaning and values in test validation: the science and ethics of assessment (1989) Educ Res, 18, pp. 5-11; Reznick, R.K., MacRae, H., Teaching surgical skills–changes in the wind (2006) N Engl J Med, 355, pp. 2664-2669; Martin, J.A., Regehr, G., Reznick, R., Macrae, H., Murnaghan, J., Hutchison, C., Brown, M., Objective structured assessment of technical skill (OSATS) for surgical residents (1997) Br J Surg, 84, pp. 273-278; Vogt, V.Y., Givens, V.M., Keathley, C.A., Lipscomb, G.H., Summitt, R.L., Is a resident’s score on a videotaped objective structured assessment of technical skills affected by revealing the resident’s identity?

However, it is believed that many of the adverse events in hospitals are preventable. Type and screen (T&S) procedures require intense practical training by each medical practitioner in each hospital. This study applied an interactive Virtual Reality (VR) technology to supplement the traditional approach to facilitate procedural training. The VR system made use of the Unity3D for application development. To investigate the reliability and validity of the conceptual medical training model, a survey was conducted to measure the content, motivation and enhanced readiness of practitioners. The partial least squares (PLS) modelling was carried out to investigate the correlation between each pair of measured variables. The study results indicated that the learning model has good reliability for each measurement factor and validates the survey study. The PLS modelling also indicated a significant correlation between each pair of measured variables. The project developed a VR training program for training in T&S procedures. The study provides important implications on the development of a practical VR training program for medical practitioners, as well as valuable insights for the development of similar VR training programs in the future. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",medical; procedures; training; type and screen; virtual reality,,"Alavi-Moghaddam, M., Bardeh, M., Alimohammadi, H., Emami, H., Hosseini, Z., Seyed, R., Blood transfusion practice before and after implementation of type and screen protocol in Emergency Department of a University Affiliated Hospital in Iran (2014) Emergency Medicine International, 2014, pp. 1-4. , https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/316463; Albrecht, J.R., Karabenick, S.A., Relevance for learning and motivation in education (2018) The Journal of Experimental Education, 86 (1), pp. 1-10. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00220973.2017.1380593; Arie, K., Marina, C., Emily, R., Catalina, K., On motivational readiness (2014) Psychological Review, 121, pp. 367-388. , https://doi.org/10.1037/a0037013; Burke, D.J., Connecting content and motivation: Education's missing link (1995) Peabody Journal of Education, 70 (2), pp. 66-81. , https://doi.org/10.1080/01619569509538823; Chung, Y.Y., Trainee readiness for diversity training (2013) Journal of Diversity Management, 8, pp. 77-84. , https://doi.org/10.19030/jdm.v8i2.8234; Cochrane, T., Cook, S., Aiello, S., Christie, D., Sinfield, D., Steagall, M., Aguayo, C., A DBR framework for designing mobile virtual reality learning environments (2017) Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 33, pp. 54-68. , https://doi.org/10.14742/ajet.3613; Dangol, R., Shrestha, M., Learning readiness and educational achievement among school students (2019) The International Journal of Indian Psychology, 7, pp. 467-476. , https://doi.org/10.25215/0702.056; Devbhandari, M.P., Farid, S., Goatman, C., Moussa, Y., Rammohan, K.S., Krysiak, P., Shah, R., Is type and screen only policy safe for patients undergoing elective lobectomy?

However, identification of clinically meaningful cognitive and functional outcomes for individuals who are, by definition, asymptomatic remains a significant challenge. Clinical trials for prevention and early intervention require measures with increased sensitivity to subtle deficits in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) that comprise the first functional declines in prodromal disease. Validation of potential endpoints is required to ensure measure sensitivity and reliability in the populations of interest.OBJECTIVES: The present research validates use of the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT) for performance-based assessment of IADL functioning in older adults (age 55+) with subjective cognitive decline.DESIGN: Cross-sectional validation study.SETTING: All participants were evaluated on-site at NeuroCog Trials, Durham, NC, USA.PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 245 healthy younger adults ages 20-54 (131 female), 247 healthy older adults ages 55-91 (151 female) and 61 older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) ages 56-97 (45 female).MEASURES: Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool; Brief Assessment of Cognition App; Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Prevention Instrument Project - Mail-In Cognitive Function Screening Instrument; Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Instrumental Activities of Daily Living - Prevention Instrument, University of California, San Diego Performance-Based Skills Assessment - Validation of Intermediate Measures; Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Trail Making Test- Part B.RESULTS: Participants with SCD performed significantly worse than age-matched normative controls on all VRFCAT endpoints, including total completion time, errors and forced progressions (p≤0001 for all, after Bonferonni correction). Consistent with prior findings, both groups performed significantly worse than healthy younger adults (age 20-54). Participants with SCD also performed significantly worse than controls on objective cognitive measures. VRFCAT performance was strongly correlated with cognitive performance. In the SCD group, VRFCAT performance was strongly correlated with cognitive performance across nearly all tests with significant correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to 0.7; VRFCAT summary measures all had correlations greater than r=0.5 with MoCA performance and BAC App Verbal Memory (p<0.01 for all).CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest the VRFCAT provides a sensitive tool for evaluation of IADL functioning in individuals with subjective cognitive decline. Strong correlations with cognition across groups suggest the VRFCAT may be uniquely suited for clinical trials in preclinical AD, as well as longitudinal investigations of the relationship between cognition and function.",assessment; endpoints; Functioning; iADL; preclinical,,,,,,NLM (Medline),,,,,24260266,,,30298179.0,English,J Prev Alzheimers Dis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054772486,43,"{'virtual', 'reality', 'reliability'}",3

While the PASAT has demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and test-retest reliability, administration of the PASAT has been known to create undue anxiety and frustration in participants. As a result, degradation of performance may be found on the PASAT. The difficult nature of the PASAT may subsequently decrease the probability of their return for follow up testing. New method: This study is a preliminary attempt at assessing the potential of a PASAT embedded in a virtual reality environment. The Virtual Reality PASAT (VR-PASAT) was compared with a paper-and-pencil version of the PASAT as well as other standardized neuropsychological measures. The two modalities of the PASAT were conducted with a sample of 50 healthy university students, between the ages of 19 and 34 years. Equivalent distributions were found for age, gender, education, and computer familiarity. Results: Moderate relationships were found between VR-PASAT and other putative attentional processing measures. The VR-PASAT was unrelated to indices of learning, memory, or visuospatial processing. Comparison with existing method(s): Comparison of the VR-PASAT with the traditional paper-and-pencil PASAT indicated that both versions require the examinee to sustain attention at an increasingly demanding, externally determined rate. Conclusions: Results offer preliminary support for the construct validity (in a college sample) of the VR-PASAT as an attentional processing measure and suggest that this task may provide some unique information not tapped by traditional attentional processing tasks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Ecological validity; Neuropsychological assessment; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; Virtual environment,"adult; article; attention; auditory discrimination; clinical assessment tool; college; computer; construct validity; education; female; gender; human; human experiment; information; male; neuropsychological test; normal human; paced auditory serial addition test; priority journal; psychometry; task performance; university student; validation study; virtual reality; Ecological validity; Neuropsychological assessment; Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; Virtual environment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attention; Auditory Perception; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Learning; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Memory; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Space Perception; Students; Universities; User-Computer Interface; Visual Perception; Young Adult","An, K.Y., Zakzanis, K.K., Joordens, S., Conducting research with non-clinical healthy undergraduates: Does effort play a role in neuropsychological test performance?

With advancing age, older people experience decreasing social activities, decreased physical activities, issues related to mental health, disturbed sleep and overall poor quality of life. Virtual reality has shown applications in healthcare domain to help mitigate these problems. The aim of our study aim is to investigate the opinions of older population about virtual reality through dimensions of technology acceptance model. We used the data generated in our previously published research to measure the opinions of older population toward VR use. Thirty participants of older age group were involved in this study (twenty-four females and 6 males) from March to May 2018. They were exposed to 12 sessions of VR experiences for 15 minutes each, twice a week for 6 weeks. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's Test were conducted to test the reliability of each questions. From Likert scale analysis, positive opinions (more than 70%) were seen towards the use of VR for entertainment, raising mood, attractiveness and fun to use VR. While the highest choice showing negative opinions in the difficulty of learning to use VR (33.3%). Our study indicates the opinion of older population that they showed positive opinions for all of the TAM variables, the index being 72% to 78.44%. The perceived VR as enjoyable to use, but they still needed time to be skillful in using it. Our study showed that providing training and ease of use is an essential element while introducing VR among older adults. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The paper aims to verify how the specific methods of virtual reality simulation could be used as an effective tool for setting an efficient participation platform between the stakeholders to improve environmental, social and energy sustainability of urban development in modern cities. The paper is based on the case study of Vilnius City. Methods The article shows how innovative tools could facilitate better cooperation based on more balanced approaches in participatory urban planning by chronological review of traditional public involvement practices and structured analysis of emerging public participation techniques. As each discipline involved in sustainable urban development covers specific socio-economic, environmental, economic and creative competence fields, it is essential to develop a comprehensive tool for public participation that is well accessible, reliable and efficient. Results The provided analysis of research theories and practical applications of public involvement through virtual simulation in the case of Vilnius City shows that virtual reality and spatial modelling integrated on gaming platforms under the conditions of widespread information and communications technology (ICT) applications could be developed and used as an innovative tool, involving an efficient tool for facilitating wider and more effective public involvement in the planning and design of urban environment and so increase social and environmental sustainability of urban development process. The application of this method for planning public spaces leads to more efficient use of environmental resources also reducing the need for primary energy and using it more rationally. Conclusions The analysis of using virtual urban simulation (VUS) method for representing, analysing, referring and improving urban design projects reveals that virtual applications can make public participation more accessible for citizens of the community and improve reliability of its results thus having direct impact on the planning process and its outcomes in terms of more sustainable impact on environmental and economic development of urban community. © 2014 Stauskis.",Landscape; Public participation; Stakeholder involvement; Urban planning; Virtual reality,Economics; Environmental technology; Reliability analysis; Simulation platform; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Urban planning; Virtual reality; Environmental resources; Information and communications technology; Landscape; Public participation; Social and environmental; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainable urban development; Virtual reality simulations; Economic and social effects,"Hackney, R., (1990) The Good, the Bad and The Ugly, , Frederick Muller, London; (2008) Real People, Real Power, , http://www.openeyecommunications.com/wpcontent/uploads/CommunitiesinControlFull.pdf, Communities in Control, Crown copyright.

This study tests if telepresence in VR news consumption can affect news credibility. In a posttest-only experiment (N = 80), 40 subjects watched VR news: 20 with a headset (Google Cardboard) and 20 in 360 degrees without a headset. A group of 20 subjects watched 2D video news. Twenty subjects only answered a questionnaire without VR exposure. The comparison of four groups revealed that VR news groups showed significantly higher telepresence than did the group with no exposure. Both the VR with a headset and 360-degree groups also marked higher in news credibility than did the group with no exposure. There were only a few significant differences between the 360-degree group and the 2D video group in telepresence and credibility. In an interaction effect test, VR news groups with high telepresence evaluated news credibility better than the group with no exposure. There were no differences among the headset, 360-degree, and 2D news groups with high telepresence in credibility. Study implications, limitations, and suggestions are discussed. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

This study focuses on preserving the cultural heritage of artifacts and sustaining tourism activities for the history of Hang Tuah Village in Melaka, Malaysia, through immersive virtual reality technology. Tourists can interact within the surrounding village, interact with the artefacts, and experienced more enjoyable learning history using the immersive virtual reality. There is no traveling required, and the exploration at its places is safer due to no Covid-19 exposition and no disturbance to the heritage place. We evaluate the usefulness of immersive virtual using the User Experience Questionnaire that originally has 16 dimensions. Five dimensions are applied: Attractiveness, perspicuity, reliability, utility, and novelty. A total number of 17 questionnaires were involved and tested on 35 respondents. As a result, the acceptability reaches 'high' with an average mean score of 4.01 or 81.2% from the overall score. With the high acceptance response, we conclude that immersive virtual reality can assist in sustaining the tourism industry to preserve the heritage of Hang Tuah Village. © 2021 IEEE.",Hang Tuah Melaka Village; immersive virtual reality; preserving heritage; user experience questionnaire,Historic preservation; Rural areas; Virtual reality; Viruses; Cultural heritages; Hang tuah melakum village; Immersive virtual reality; Malaysia; Preserving heritage; Tourism activities; Tourism industry; User experience questionnaire; Users' experiences; Virtual reality technology; Surveys,"Syakir, A., Osman, M.M., Bachok, S., Ibrahim, M., Sustaining local community economy through tourism: Melaka UNESCO world heritage city (2015) Procedia Environmental Sciences, 28, pp. 443-452; Amir, S., Osman, M.M., Bachok, S., Ibrahim, M., Zen, I., Community-based tourism in Melaka UNESCO world heritage area: A success in food and beverage sector?

Understanding this process is important not only from a basic science perspective but also for translational reasons, e.g. for the development of closed-loop neural prosthetic systems. Here we describe a versatile virtual reality platform which can be used to study the neural mechanisms of multisensory integration for the upper limb and could potentially be incorporated into systems for training of robust neural prosthetic control. The platform involves the interaction of multiple computers and programs and allows for selection of different avatar arms and for modification of a selected arm's visual properties. The system was tested with two non-human primates (NHP) that were trained to reach to multiple targets on a tabletop. Reliability of arm visual feedback was altered by applying different levels of blurring to the arm. In addition, tactile feedback was altered by adding or removing physical targets from the environment. We observed differences in movement endpoint distributions that varied between animals and visual feedback conditions, as well as across targets. The results indicate that the system can be used to study multisensory integration in a well-controlled manner. © 2020 IEEE.",,E-learning; Integration; Mammals; Neural prostheses; Prosthetics; Virtual reality; Visual communication; Multiple computers; Multisensory integration; Neural mechanisms; Neural prosthetic; Non-human primate; Prosthetic controls; Tactile feedback; Visual properties; Feedback,"Faisal, A.A., Selen, L.P.J., Wolpert, D.M., Noise in the nervous system (2008) Nat.

The retrospective and subjective nature of these methods leads to recall and interviewer biases. Therefore, there is a clear need for more objective and standardized assessment methods to support the diagnostic process. The introduction of virtual reality (VR) creates the possibility to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, VR could contribute to the objectivity and reliability in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Objective: In this literature review, we will evaluate the assessment of psychiatric disorders by means of VR environments. First, we investigate if these VR environments are capable of simultaneously provoking and measuring psychiatric symptoms. Next, we compare these measures with traditional diagnostic measures. Methods: We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Embase, and Psycinfo; references of selected articles were checked for eligibility. We identified studies from 1990 to 2016 on VR used in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. Studies were excluded if VR was used for therapeutic purposes, if a different technique was used, or in case of limitation to a non-clinical sample. Results: A total of 39 studies were included for further analysis. The disorders most frequently studied included schizophrenia (n = 15), developmental disorders (n = 12), eating disorders (n = 3), and anxiety disorders (n = 6). In attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the most comprehensive measurement was used including several key symptoms of the disorder. Most of the studies, however, concerned the use of VR to assess a single aspect of a psychiatric disorder. Discussion: In general, nearly all VR environments studied were able to simultaneously provoke and measure psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, in 14 studies, significant correlations were found between VR measures and traditional diagnostic measures. Relatively small clinical sample sizes were used, impeding definite conclusions. Based on this review, the innovative technique of VR shows potential to contribute to objectivity and reliability in the psychiatric diagnostic process. © 2017 van Bennekom, de Koning and Denys.",Assessment;

While the research on CAs is growing rapidly, less attention is paid to CAs in virtual reality (VR) environments with respect to how the design of these agents influences their trustworthiness as perceived by users, which is key to the adoption and use of VR products featuring CAs. Accordingly, this position paper conceptualizes an immersive model of user trust in CAs in VR. The model is centered around users' sense of co-presence with CAs in VR, which is influenced by the agents' embodiment, expressiveness, and responsiveness. © 2021 IEEE.",,Product design; User interfaces; Co-presence; Conversational agents; Health informations; Immersive modeling; Information provider; Personal assistants; Position papers; Virtual-reality environment; Virtual reality,"van Pinxteren, M.M., Pluymaekers, M., Lemmink, J.G., Human-like communication in conversational agents: A literature review and research agenda (2020) Journal of Service Management; Carrozzino, M.A., Galdieri, R., Machidon, O.M., Bergamasco, M., Do virtual humans dream of digital sheep?

During the past decade, virtual reality (VR) has become a new component in the treatment of patients after stroke. Therefore aims of the study were (a) to get an insight into experiences and expectations of physiotherapists and occupational therapists in using a VR training system and (b) to investigate relevant facilitators, barriers, and risks for implementing VR training in clinical practice. Methods. Three focus groups were conducted with occupational therapists and physiotherapists, specialised in rehabilitation of patients after stroke. All data were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The study was analysed based on a phenomenological approach using qualitative content analysis. Results. After code refinements, a total number of 1289 codes emerged out of 1626 statements. Intercoder reliability increased from 53% to 91% until the last focus group. The final coding scheme included categories on a four-level hierarchy: first-level categories are (a) therapists and VR, (b) VR device, (c) patients and VR, and (d) future prospects and potential of VR developments. Conclusions. Results indicate that interprofessional collaboration is needed to develop future VR technology and to devise VR implementation strategies in clinical practice. In principal, VR technology devices were seen as supportive for a general health service model. © 2016 Ludwig Schmid et al.",,adult; Article; audio recording; cerebrovascular accident; clinical practice; coding; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; information processing; male; middle aged; occupational therapist attitude; patient selection; physiotherapist attitude; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; rehabilitation equipment; stroke patient; stroke rehabilitation; therapeutic virtual reality system; virtual reality,"Kolominsky-Rabas, P.L., Heuschmann, P.U., Marschall, D., Lifetime cost of ischemic stroke in Germany: Results and national projections from a population-based stroke registry-TheErlangen Stroke Project (2006) Stroke, 37 (5), pp. 1179-1183; Henderson, A., Korner-Bitensky, N., Levin, M., Virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation: A systematic review of its effectiveness for upper limb motor recovery (2007) Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, 14 (2), pp. 52-61; Krakauer, J.W., Motor learning: Its relevance to stroke recovery and neurorehabilitation (2006) Current Opinion in Neurology, 19 (1), pp. 84-90; Sisto, S.A., Forrest, G.F., Glendinning, D., Virtual reality applications for motor rehabilitation after stroke (2002) Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation, 8 (4), pp. 11-23; Lange, B., Koenig, S., Chang, C.-Y., Designing informed game-based rehabilitation tasks leveraging advances in virtual reality (2012) Disability and Rehabilitation, 34 (22), pp. 1863-1870; Reid, D., Hirji, T., The influence of a virtual reality leisure intervention program on the motivation of older adult stroke survivors: A Pilot Study (2004) Physical and OccupationalTherapy in Geriatrics, 21 (4), pp. 1-19; Eng, K., Siekierka, E., Pyk, P., Interactive visuo-motor therapy systemfor stroke rehabilitation (2007) Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, 45 (9), pp. 901-907; Saposnik, G., Levin, M., Virtual reality in stroke rehabilitation: A meta-analysis and implications for clinicians (2011) Stroke, 42 (5), pp. 1380-1386; Moreira, M.C., De Amorim Lima, A.M., Ferraz, K.M., Benedetti Rodrigues, M.A., Use of virtual reality in gait recovery among post stroke patients-A systematic literature review (2013) Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology, 8 (5), pp. 357-362; Wulf, G., Shea, C., Lewthwaite, R., Motor skill learning and performance: A reviewof influential factors, ""Medical (2010) Education, 44 (1), pp. 75-84; Farrow, S., Reid, D., Stroke survivors' perceptions of a leisure-based virtual reality program (2004) Technology and Disability, 16 (2), pp. 69-81; Fager, S.K., Burnfield, J.M., Patients' experiences with technology during inpatient rehabilitation: Opportunities to support independence and therapeutic engagement (2014) Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology, 9 (2), pp. 121-127; Sim, J., Collecting and analysing qualitative data: Issues raised by the focus group (1998) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 28 (2), pp. 345-352; Giorgi, A., The phenomenological movement and research in the human sciences (2005) Nursing Science Quarterly, 18 (1), pp. 75-82; Tong, A., Sainsbury, P., Craig, J., Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ): A 32-itemchecklist for interviews and focus groups (2007) International Journal for Quality in Health Care, 19 (6), pp. 349-357; Kitzinger, J., Qualitative research: Introducing focus groups (1995) British Medical Journal, 311 (7000), pp. 299-302; Dresing, T., Pehl, T., Transkription (2012) Praxisbuch Interview & Transkription.

Methods: We designed a desktop VR system, using a three-dimensional (3D) monitor and a six degrees-of-freedom tracking system. A personal computer uses the V-Scope (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) volume-rendering application, developed for the I-Space, to create a hologram of volumetric data. Inter- and intraobserver reliability for crown-rump length and embryonic volume measurements are investigated using Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients. Time required for the measurements was recorded. Results: Comparing the I-Space and the desktop VR system, the mean difference for crown-rump length is -0.34% (limits of agreement -2.58-1.89, ±2.24%) and for embryonic volume -0.92% (limits of agreement -6.97-5.13, ±6.05%). Intra- and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients of the desktop VR system were all >0.99. Measurement times were longer on the desktop VR system compared with the I-Space, but the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: A user-friendly desktop VR system can be put together using commercially off-the-shelf hardware at an acceptable price. This system provides a valid and reliable method for embryonic length and volume measurements and can be used in clinical practice. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Image processing; Reproducibility; Three-dimensional ultrasound; Virtual reality; Volume measurement,"anatomy and histology; body size; computer interface; crown rump length; female; fetus; fetus echography; first trimester pregnancy; human; observer variation; pregnancy; reproducibility; three dimensional imaging; validation study; Body Size; Crown-Rump Length; Female; Fetus; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Observer Variation; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First; Reproducibility of Results; Ultrasonography, Prenatal; User-Computer Interface","Cruz-Neira, C., Sandin, D.J., DeFanti, T.A., Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality: the design and implementation of the CAVE (1993), p. 135. , Proceedings of the 20th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques; Koning, A.H., Rousian, M., Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C.M., V-scope: design and implementation of an immersive and desktop virtual reality volume visualization system (2009) Stud Health Technol Inform, 142, p. 136; van Adrichem, L.N., van Vlimmeren, L.A., Cadanova, D., Validation of a simple method for measuring cranial deformities (plagiocephalometry) (2008) J Craniofac Surg, 19, p. 15; Meuffels, D.E., Potters, J.W., Koning, A.H., Visualization of postoperative anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction bone tunnels: reliability of standard radiographs, CT scans, and 3D virtual reality images (2011) Acta Orthop, 82, p. 699; Bol Raap, G., Koning, A.H., Scohy, T.V., Virtual reality 3D echocardiography in the assessment of tricuspid valve function after surgical closure of ventricular septal defect (2007) Cardiovasc Ultrasound, 5, p. 8; van den Bosch, A.E., Koning, A.H., Meijboom, F.J., Dynamic 3D echocardiography in virtual reality (2005) Cardiovasc Ultrasound, 3, p. 37; van Oppenraaij, R.H., Koning, A.H., Lisman, B.A., Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the first trimester human placenta: an innovative 3D study using an immersive Virtual Reality system (2009) Placenta, 30, p. 220; Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C.M., Koning, A.H., Hop, W.C., Innovative virtual reality measurements for embryonic growth and development (2010) Hum Reprod, 25, p. 1404; Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C.M., Koning, A.H., Hop, W.C., Reliability of three-dimensional sonographic measurements in early pregnancy using virtual reality (2008) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 32, p. 910; Rousian, M., Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C.M., Koning, A.H., Early pregnancy volume measurements: validation of ultrasound techniques and new perspectives (2009) BJOG, 116, p. 278; Groenenberg, I.A., Koning, A.H., Galjaard, R.J., A virtual reality rendition of a fetal meningomyelocele at 32 weeks of gestation (2005) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 26, p. 799; Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C.M., Koning, A.H., Groenenberg, I.A., Using virtual reality for evaluation of fetal ambiguous genitalia (2008) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 32, p. 510; Rousian, M., Verwoerd-Dikkeboom, C.M., Koning, A.H., First trimester umbilical cord and vitelline duct measurements using virtual reality (2011) Early Hum Dev, 87, p. 77; Rousian, M., Koning, A.H., Hop, W.C., Gestational sac fluid volume measurements in virtual reality (2011) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 38, p. 524; Rousian, M., Koning, A.H., van Oppenraaij, R.H., An innovative virtual reality technique for automated human embryonic volume measurements (2010) Hum Reprod, 25, p. 2210; Myers, L.M., Brinkley, J.F., Visualization of brain surface features using registered partially segmented MRI scans (1995) Image Display; SPIE Med Imaging, 2431, p. 43; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., A note on the use of the intraclass correlation coefficient in the evaluation of agreement between two methods of measurement (1990) Comput Biol Med, 20, p. 337; Bland, J.M., Altman, D.G., Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement (1986) Lancet, 1, p. 307; Kockro, R.A., Serra, L., Tseng-Tsai, Y., Planning and simulation of neurosurgery in a virtual reality environment (2000) Neurosurgery, 46, p. 118; Aviram, R., Shpan, D.K., Markovitch, O., Three-dimensional first trimester fetal volumetry: comparison with crown rump length (2004) Early Hum Dev, 80, p. 1; Falcon, O., Peralta, C.F., Cavoretto, P., Fetal trunk and head volume in chromosomally abnormal fetuses at 11+0 to 13+6 weeks of gestation (2005) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 26, p. 517; Baken, L., van Heesch, P.N., Wildschut, H.I., First-trimester crown-rump length and embryonic volume of aneuploid fetuses measured in virtual reality (2013) Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol, 41, p. 521; Fajardo-Exposito, M.A., Hervias, B., Gonzalez, F.B., First trimester fetal head and trunk volume predict growth disturbance in twin pregnancy (2011) Prenat Diagn, 31, p. 543; Antsaklis, A., Anastasakis, E., Komita, O., First trimester 3D volumetry.

In line with advances from VR technology, YouTube initiates to support the spread of VR videos by creating a VR feature on their platform. A hundred videos about a dangerous activity, Horror activity, and Marketing video of software or a movie product are found on the YouTube platform. Meanwhile, it is still not yet known how the effectiveness of an advertisement using VR video via the YouTube platform on the people desires to buy a product, especially in Indonesia, which then became the purpose of this study. In carrying out this study, a quantitative study was used by creating a digital questionnaire and distributed it with Google Forms. Then the data obtained will be processed by the respondent demographics and the 4 types of analysis, such as the Validity analysis, the Reliability analysis, the Ranking of VR applications on product promotions, and the Correlation analysis. Afterward, the study found that the B1 and B2 variables refer to Advertising, making it easy for us to understand the product has the most correlation coefficient.

During the teleoperation welding process, 6-DOF controller's signal can be converted into welding torch's position, velocity or acceleration changing which is being controlled. For welding purposes, control strategies of four modes are designed, which are static position and posture mode, dynamic position and posture mode, velocity mode and acceleration mode. A test and analysis system for testing the tracking accuracy and reliability of control strategy based on virtual reality is developed. The tracking accuracies of the four control strategies are studied in the following tests with straight line trajectory, curve trajectory or space curve trajectory. The results show that the control strategy in dynamic position and posture mode has best stability and strong adaptability which is the most suitable for the teleoperation system.
